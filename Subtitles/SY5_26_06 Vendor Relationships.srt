1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:00,933
- Whenever you're dealing

2
00:00:00,933 --> 00:00:02,890
with vendors outside your organization,

3
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:04,390
you're going to need
to have some agreements

4
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:05,930
and contracts in place.

5
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:08,090
That's what we're going to
talk about in this lesson.

6
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:13,090
We're going to discuss NDAs,
MOUs, SLAs, ISAs, and BPAs.

7
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:15,310
The first is an NDA.

8
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:17,390
An NDA is a non-disclosure agreement,

9
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:19,260
and it's an agreement between two parties

10
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:21,680
that define what data is
considered confidential

11
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,560
and can't be shared outside
of that relationship.

12
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,530
NDAs are often used by organizations

13
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:28,430
to protect their intellectual property,

14
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:30,390
and they're either between
different organizations

15
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:32,850
or between an organization
and their employees.

16
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:35,120
Now why would an organization
require their employee

17
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,400
to sign an NDA?

18
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:38,710
Well, it's because
those NDAs can be a form

19
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:41,930
of a non-competitive clause
inside the employee contract.

20
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:43,810
And this is because companies might fear

21
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:45,400
that their employee might
take the information

22
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:46,720
they learned from that organization

23
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:48,760
and then go off and
start their own business.

24
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:50,680
Now when two companies are working jointly

25
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:53,610
on developing a product,
they can also use an NDA.

26
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:55,180
This allows the companies to share

27
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:57,660
the type of data they need in
the development of the product

28
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:59,310
without fear of the other company

29
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:01,180
stealing their trade secrets.

30
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:03,440
Now NDAs don't prevent
data from being shared

31
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,690
through a technical control,

32
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:07,150
instead this is an administrative control.

33
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:08,710
This is because the NDA states

34
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:10,580
the penalties for breaking the NDA,

35
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:12,090
which may include fines,

36
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:14,250
forfeiture of intellectual
property rights,

37
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:17,300
or even jail time in some
extreme circumstances.

38
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:19,420
NDAs are considered legally binding

39
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:21,400
and they are a legally-binding agreement.

40
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,470
They can be upheld through contract law

41
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:25,350
inside of a court of law.

42
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:26,969
Next we have MOUs.

43
00:01:26,969 --> 00:01:29,680
MOUs are a memorandum of understanding.

44
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,440
And this is a non-binding agreement

45
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,280
between two or more organizations

46
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,900
to detail what common line of action

47
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:37,400
they're intending to take.

48
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,410
Now essentially, this is a formal version

49
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:40,680
of a gentlemen's agreement

50
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:41,990
because it's actually written down

51
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:43,550
and signed by all parties.

52
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:45,700
But it's pretty much
like a handshake, right?

53
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:47,760
If you and I agreed to
go into business together

54
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:50,010
and I understand you're
going to do x, y, and z,

55
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:52,300
and you understand that I'm
going to do a, b, and c,

56
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:54,100
that's what an MOU does.

57
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:56,870
An MOU is often referred
to as a letter of intent,

58
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:59,100
and it's most often used
within an organization

59
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:01,440
by two of its smaller internal divisions.

60
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,330
For example, in one of my past jobs,

61
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:04,870
I was in a large organization

62
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:07,180
and I was the director
of the IT department

63
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:08,860
and we managed the service desk.

64
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:10,520
Now my service desk provided service

65
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:13,750
to several-thousand employees
across multiple countries.

66
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:16,550
We had an MOU in place with
one critical business unit

67
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:17,910
that would say that we would have

68
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:19,561
at least one field service technician

69
00:02:19,561 --> 00:02:21,570
embedded at their offices,

70
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:22,970
so that if something went down,

71
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:24,510
that person didn't have to get in the car

72
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:26,890
and drive to their office,
they were already there.

73
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:28,830
This helped minimize the
time to repair the issues

74
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:30,450
that popped up at any time.

75
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:32,650
Now this wasn't a binding
agreement on our part

76
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:34,560
and at any time, I could
have said, you know what,

77
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,620
I need Tommy to come
back to the main office

78
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:38,450
and he can't sit in your office anymore,

79
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:39,810
but this agreement, this MOU,

80
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:42,440
gave us some formality to
the agreement that was made

81
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,790
between their director of the operations

82
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:46,990
and myself as the IT director.

83
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:49,180
Now, while MOUs can be used internally

84
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:51,590
between two business
units, as in my example,

85
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:53,060
they can also be used externally

86
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:54,400
between your organization

87
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,470
and one or more other organizations.

88
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:57,620
There are some consortiums

89
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:59,770
where they have a multiparty MOU

90
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:01,070
where you might have five or six

91
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:03,510
or seven people come
together for a common goal.

92
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:05,530
But remember, it is not legally binding

93
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:07,073
when you're dealing with MOUs.

94
00:03:07,073 --> 00:03:09,610
Another business document
to consider using

95
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:13,260
is what's known as a
service-level agreement or SLA.

96
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:15,300
Now this agreement is
concerned with the ability

97
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:18,420
to support and respond to
problems within a given timeframe

98
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:19,810
while providing the agreed upon

99
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:21,530
level of service to the user.

100
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:23,910
If you work in the IT
service management realm,

101
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:26,044
you're probably very familiar with SLAs.

102
00:03:26,044 --> 00:03:28,570
SLAs are used to provide
a written agreement

103
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:30,260
for not only the security priorities

104
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:32,720
but more importantly, those
operational priorities.

105
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,200
It also outlines the
responsibilities, guarantees,

106
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,370
and warranties for a given
service and its components.

107
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:40,910
For example, in one of my
previous organizations,

108
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:43,110
we didn't want to have to
keep a bunch of extra switches

109
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:45,270
and routers in our supply closet

110
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:46,570
because we don't want to have that expense

111
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:48,070
for them just sitting on the shelf.

112
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:50,450
So instead we had a
service-level agreement in place

113
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:53,400
with our supplier that said if
we lose a router or a switch

114
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,930
and it goes down, they would
bring us a brand new one

115
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:57,780
within four hours of the outage.

116
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:59,110
These service-level agreements

117
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:01,410
can help to bring some
level of predictability

118
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:03,360
to an otherwise hard-to-predict area.

119
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,010
That is, of course, if
your service provider

120
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:07,040
lives up to their end of the agreement.

121
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,570
Now, another place you're
often going to see SLAs

122
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:12,560
is in regard to your internet
connections or your ISP.

123
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,650
For example, my internet service provider

124
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:16,240
has a service-level agreement with us

125
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:20,390
that states they're going to
maintain an uptime of 99.999%,

126
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:21,360
and that equates to having

127
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,780
no more than five minutes
of downtime per year.

128
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:26,020
Now, because it's a
service-level agreement,

129
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:30,110
if they don't meet that
99.999% uptime, what happens?

130
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:31,670
Well, that depends on your agreement

131
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:33,430
and your underlying contracts.

132
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:36,100
Some contracts have penalties
for not meeting your SLAs,

133
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:37,370
and some don't.

134
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:40,130
Next let's talk about information sharing.

135
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:42,720
Often, multiple organizations
want to work together

136
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,520
and that requires them
to share information

137
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,010
between their networks.

138
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:48,520
An agreement that focuses
on connecting two systems

139
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,100
from two different organizations

140
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:53,810
is called an interconnection
service agreement or ISA.

141
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:55,590
An ISA is an agreement that allows

142
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:58,200
the owners and operators
of the two IT systems

143
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,090
to document what technical requirements

144
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:02,000
each organization has to meet.

145
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,620
If your organization
is planning to connect

146
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:05,550
its network to another organization,

147
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:06,700
it's a good idea to ensure

148
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:09,100
you have an interconnection
security agreement in place

149
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,041
detailing exactly what level of security

150
00:05:11,041 --> 00:05:13,230
each organization needs to meet.

151
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:14,450
So what's a good example

152
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:16,350
of an interconnection service agreement?

153
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:17,931
Well, one good place to use this

154
00:05:17,931 --> 00:05:20,410
would be if you have your
heating and air provider

155
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:22,340
who wants to be able to
connect their systems

156
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:25,110
to remotely diagnose their
heating and air system

157
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:26,820
remotely over your network.

158
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:28,040
Now if they want to do that,

159
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:28,873
they don't want to have to go

160
00:05:28,873 --> 00:05:30,720
and install their own network line,

161
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,840
bring their whole ISP
to be able to connect

162
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:33,970
to the air conditioning system.

163
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:36,110
So they may say, hey, can we plug in

164
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:38,240
this air conditioning
system into your network

165
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,640
and ride your network
back out to the internet

166
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,310
and use it as transport?

167
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:44,600
Well, they can do this if
you decide to allow them

168
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:47,010
and you guys have an ISA in place.

169
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:48,360
You could put an ISA in place

170
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,960
that says their data is
going to be encrypted,

171
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,490
tunneled over a VPN, and use your network

172
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:57,240
for transport only, and they
have to meet x, y, and z level

173
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,850
of security before you're
going to allow them to plug in.

174
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:01,370
Now if you're going to
do something like this,

175
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:02,350
you need to think through

176
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:04,050
all of the security effects to it

177
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:05,730
because any time you allow somebody else

178
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:06,890
to plug into your network,

179
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:08,480
whatever vulnerabilities they have

180
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,416
are going to be inherited by your network.

181
00:06:10,416 --> 00:06:14,450
Next we have a business
partnership agreement or a BPA.

182
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:16,190
Now business partnership agreement

183
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:18,390
is conducted between tow business partners

184
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:21,310
that establishes the conditions
of their relationship.

185
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:23,610
These include things like
each person's responsibility

186
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:27,020
as well as the revenue, system,
and data sharing details.

187
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:28,580
One example of this is my company.

188
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:30,760
We entered into a business
partnership agreement

189
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:33,260
with another company to produce
an online training course

190
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:37,310
on the CompTIA Advanced Security
Practitioner or CASP+ Exam.

191
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:39,120
Now in our agreement, it clearly stated

192
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,660
that I was responsible for
writing all of the scripts

193
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:42,710
and all of the videos,

194
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:44,760
flying out to their studios to film it,

195
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,800
but my partner was responsible

196
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,540
for providing me travel expenses.

197
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:50,730
They had to provide a production
crew to film the course

198
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:52,980
and then they had to be
responsible for all of the editing

199
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:55,200
and post-production and marketing work.

200
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,090
This agreement stated

201
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:57,830
that I would get x percent of the sales

202
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:59,980
and they would be able to
keep y percent of the sales,

203
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:01,450
and it also outlined whether or not

204
00:07:01,450 --> 00:07:03,700
I could create a competing
video-based course

205
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:05,640
covering that same certification.

206
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:08,470
So to answer a question I
get a lot from my students,

207
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:11,520
no, you can't find my
CASP+ course on anywhere

208
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,940
except for LinkedIn Learning

209
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:15,210
because of this BPA we
have in place with them,

210
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:18,150
said we would make the course
exclusive to their platform.

211
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:21,190
So for that reason, you're not
going to find my CASP+ course

212
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:24,330
on my own site, diontraining,
or any other site out there.

213
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:26,620
Now in addition to all the
contractual obligations

214
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:28,680
that are outlined in the
business partnership agreement,

215
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,750
you can also include
language in that agreement

216
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:33,440
that talks about the security
that each organization

217
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,110
has to maintain for their networks

218
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:37,770
and the shared data and
resources of the partnership.

219
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:40,070
For example, if your
organization doesn't allow

220
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:41,690
the use of removable media,

221
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:43,690
you could specify in the
partnership agreement

222
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:45,980
how your files are going
to be delivered to you

223
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:48,070
and that might be through
a cloud storage provider

224
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:49,660
or some other technical means.

225
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:52,519
All of that can be covered
inside of your BPA.

226
00:07:52,519 --> 00:07:55,267
