1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:03,730
- Auditing; auditing is
a technical assessment

2
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:07,150
conducted on applications,
systems, or networks.

3
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:09,620
Auditing is essentially
a detective control.

4
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:11,140
We're looking to make sure everything

5
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:13,460
was being done correctly,
and if anything went wrong,

6
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:16,070
we can go back and put
together those pieces.

7
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:17,420
Now when you think about auditing,

8
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:20,360
auditing can be conducted
manually or using tools.

9
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:21,910
For a manual audit, you're going to review

10
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:23,770
the organization's security logs,

11
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:26,510
access control lists, user
rights and permissions,

12
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:29,240
their group policies,
their vulnerability scans,

13
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:30,900
their written organizational policies,

14
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:33,070
and you may interview personnel.

15
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:35,410
When I think of auditing,
especially on the exam,

16
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:38,170
think of the fact that
logs are part of auditing

17
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:40,920
because those get tied
together very frequently

18
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,860
inside the auditing concept.

19
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:45,770
Now when we talk about auditing,
there's also software tools

20
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:47,810
that we can use to conduct auditing.

21
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:50,120
Programs like the built in
auditing and logging features

22
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:52,490
inside Windows and
Linux are really useful,

23
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:55,260
but there's also complex
auditing suites available

24
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:57,940
that you can buy as
commercially available products.

25
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:00,430
As I said, auditing
can be a manual process

26
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:04,200
or an automated one, but usually
it's a combination of both.

27
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,660
When I conduct security audits

28
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:07,000
of an organization's security,

29
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,740
I usually first sit down
with their leadership

30
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:11,570
and determine what the scope
of the audit is going to be.

31
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:13,030
I want to ensure that
they have good backups

32
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:14,600
of the network before I get started.

33
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,630
Then I'll scan their
network for vulnerabilities

34
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:18,180
using a vulnerability scanning tool,

35
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:20,432
and while that's being
run, then I'll go back

36
00:01:20,432 --> 00:01:22,280
and I'll start looking at their policies

37
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,710
and interviewing their
people and doing all that

38
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:25,240
offline type of stuff.

39
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:26,950
Then I can bring it all back together,

40
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:30,060
collate all that data, come
up with a prioritized plan

41
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:31,970
of action, and then I can tell them

42
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:34,090
what kind of risks they
need to mitigate first,

43
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:36,390
and which are the things they
need to put money towards

44
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:38,680
to best secure their
network much more quickly

45
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,030
and more efficiently.

46
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:41,450
This is the whole idea of auditing.

47
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:42,830
It's when you go into a network

48
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:44,620
and you start figuring out exactly what

49
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:46,740
that security posture is, and make sure

50
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,840
things are being done right, and logs

51
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,880
are a big part of that,
because it's going to tell you

52
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,678
whether things really
are being done that way,

53
00:01:52,678 --> 00:01:54,827
or if they're not.

54
00:01:54,827 --> 00:01:57,103
