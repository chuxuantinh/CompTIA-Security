1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:01,340
- In the last lesson,

2
00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:03,560
we discussed the different
types of power conditions

3
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:05,180
that can affect our systems.

4
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:06,240
Now, to mitigate these,

5
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,290
we used different forms of backup power.

6
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:10,000
The first type of backup power we have

7
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,620
is called a UPS or an
Uninterruptible Power Supply

8
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:15,180
and this is going to
combine the functionality

9
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:17,880
of a surge suppressor
with a battery backup.

10
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:19,110
Now, the great thing about these

11
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:21,220
is they can also provide
line conditioning.

12
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:22,530
So they can protect against things like

13
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:24,370
brown outs, sags and surges.

14
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:25,870
So if you have short durations of times

15
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:27,388
where the power goes down or goes up,

16
00:00:27,388 --> 00:00:29,340
that line conditioning function

17
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:30,690
can help protect your machines

18
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:32,330
and keep them running smoothly.

19
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:35,740
Now, backups like these are
good for short durations of time

20
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:38,390
but they usually don't last
more than 15 or 30 minutes.

21
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:39,710
Some of the largest ones I've seen

22
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:41,170
and most expensive ones I've seen

23
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:43,470
can actually last up to about 60 minutes.

24
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:46,219
But again, this is a relatively
short period of time.

25
00:00:46,219 --> 00:00:48,110
So if you need to go longer than that,

26
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:50,290
we start looking at a backup generator.

27
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:53,210
A backup generator is part
of an emergency power system.

28
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:54,400
It's used when there's an outage

29
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,725
of your regular power supply
for the electric grid.

30
00:00:56,725 --> 00:00:59,840
Now, some emergency power
systems might include things like

31
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,790
lighting for your hallways
or special fuel cells.

32
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:04,260
Larger commercial backup generators

33
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:06,150
can actually power the entire building

34
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:07,710
or large portions of it.

35
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:10,050
Now, it just depends on how
much fuel you have available

36
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:12,090
and how much power you need to generate.

37
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:13,670
There's really three types of generators

38
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:14,700
that we're going to talk about.

39
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,750
There's portable gas-engine generators,

40
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:18,180
permanently installed generators,

41
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:20,160
and battery-inverter generators.

42
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,850
A portable gas-engine generator

43
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:23,760
is the least expensive type to run

44
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:27,860
and it usually uses gasoline
or sometimes even solar power.

45
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:29,950
These tend to be noisy
when they're gas engines.

46
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:31,120
They're high maintenance

47
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,600
and they have to be started manually

48
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,290
and you'll usually plug
in an extension cord

49
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:35,840
and run that into your building.

50
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,390
So, you're not going to use
this for a large server room

51
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:40,710
but you may be able to keep
some specialized equipment up

52
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:42,723
and running using one of
these portable systems.

53
00:01:42,723 --> 00:01:45,000
Now, when you start going
to larger generators,

54
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,600
you start talking about
permanently installed generators.

55
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,070
These are much more expensive

56
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:51,170
and much more complex to install.

57
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:52,920
But they're always there.

58
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,930
Generally, these will run on natural gas,

59
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:57,050
propane or diesel fuel.

60
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:58,110
They tend to be quieter

61
00:01:58,110 --> 00:01:58,943
and they can be connected directly

62
00:01:58,943 --> 00:02:00,960
to your organizations electric panel.

63
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,450
So if you lose power to the building,

64
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:04,170
somebody can go and turn on this generator

65
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:05,890
and bring it back online.

66
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:07,380
The third type of generator that we have

67
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:09,790
is known as a battery inverter generator.

68
00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:11,670
These are based on lead acid batteries.

69
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:12,870
They're supper quiet

70
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:15,290
and they require very
little user interaction,

71
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:17,660
aside from maybe an uncommon
restart once in a while

72
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:20,200
and changing out the batteries
every couple of years.

73
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,730
They are well matched to environments

74
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:23,670
that require a low amount of wattage

75
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:26,600
or are the victims of
short power outages only.

76
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,540
They can't withhold your whole facility

77
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:30,760
or data center for a long period of time.

78
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:33,471
But if you combine something
like the battery generators

79
00:02:33,471 --> 00:02:36,120
with the diesel commercial generators,

80
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,540
you can actually have the battery

81
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:39,070
take over the short period of time

82
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:41,570
and the diesels take over
the long period of time.

83
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:42,800
So, how do you decide

84
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,500
which ones right for your organization?

85
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:47,090
Well, it's going to depend
on your organizations needs,

86
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:49,380
the amount of money you want
to spend on backup power,

87
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:51,230
how much downtime you can afford to have

88
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:52,310
and how quickly that power

89
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:54,000
needs to be provided to your systems.

90
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,190
Also, you need to consider
the type of fuel source

91
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:57,370
that's available in your area.

92
00:02:57,370 --> 00:02:59,110
Do you have gas or propane?

93
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:01,080
Or diesel or batteries available?

94
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,610
All of that is going to
factor into your decision

95
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:06,160
to decide which type of
generator is right for you.
