1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,400
- In this lesson, we're
going to jump into the lab,

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:05,330
and I'm going to tell you how
to create good group policies

3
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:06,360
for your passwords.

4
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:08,330
We're going to focus on four key areas.

5
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:10,770
We're going to talk
about complexity, length,

6
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:13,080
password reuse, and password age.

7
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,480
Let's go ahead and jump
in the lab environment

8
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:15,313
and get started.

9
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:18,610
In order for us to create
our password policies,

10
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:20,730
we're going to use the
group policy editor.

11
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:22,560
I'm using a Windows 10 machine here

12
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,880
on a local computer network
that is not part of a domain.

13
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:26,920
Using a domain environment,

14
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:29,620
you can use your global
policy orchestrator,

15
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:30,640
but for a local machine,

16
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,840
we're going to stick with
the group policy editor.

17
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:33,890
Now, to do this, we're going to go to

18
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:37,840
our computer configuration and
click on "Windows settings,"

19
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,800
and then we're going to
select, underneath it,

20
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,143
the security settings.

21
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:43,510
Underneath security settings,

22
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:45,763
you'll see that we have account policies,

23
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:50,610
and inside there we have
the password policy.

24
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:51,700
Now you'll see that there are

25
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:53,160
several different settings here,

26
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,350
including enforcing the password history,

27
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:57,360
the minimum age, the maximum age,

28
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,700
the minimum password length,

29
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:00,990
the password that must meet
complexity requirements,

30
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:03,720
and storing your passwords
using reversible encryption.

31
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:07,250
So first we're going to go
through and set up our complexity.

32
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:10,460
Complexity talks about how
that password needs to be.

33
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:12,660
Does it need to have
upper case and lower case?

34
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:14,240
Special characters and numbers?

35
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,460
So if we right click it
and go to properties,

36
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:17,470
we can then select it,

37
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:20,620
and just simply enable it, and hit apply.

38
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:24,110
This is going to require that
our password now have complexity.

39
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:25,870
It means it's going to
have at least characters

40
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:28,280
from three of the
following four categories.

41
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:30,370
That would be upper case, lower case,

42
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:32,170
numbers, and special characters.

43
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:35,880
So if I have something that
has password 1 exclamation,

44
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,500
that would meet password complexity,

45
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,460
according to this definition.

46
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:40,920
Next we'll hit "okay."

47
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,110
and we're going to go to our next thing,

48
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:44,090
which is going to be our
minimum password length.

49
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:46,370
Right now, that is zero characters.

50
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:49,430
Zero characters means I
can have a blank password.

51
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:50,770
Now if you remember from my lessons,

52
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:52,540
what did I recommend that we use?

53
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:55,170
Something of at least
14 characters, or more.

54
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:56,700
According to the Security Plus exam,

55
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,440
we want at least eight characters.

56
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:01,690
And so, we would have a
minimum of eight characters.

57
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:03,740
But for your security, and mine,

58
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:05,770
I'm going to use 14 characters.

59
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:07,440
And again you'll hit "apply."

60
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,560
And if you look at the explanation,

61
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,010
it explains that you can have it

62
00:02:10,010 --> 00:02:12,440
anything between one and 20 characters.

63
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:15,780
If you have it set to zero,
it would be no password.

64
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:17,470
Go ahead an hit "okay."

65
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:20,010
And the next thing we're going
to do is our password age.

66
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:21,970
How old must our password be?

67
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:24,270
Can our password be
change and be zero days?

68
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:25,600
That's fine.

69
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,690
What is the maximum?

70
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:28,900
Right now it's saying 42 days.

71
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:30,120
That means every 42 days,

72
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,910
I'm going to have to change that password.

73
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:33,320
If you remember what I recommended,

74
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,830
it was something like 90 days, right?

75
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:39,010
And so we can hit "apply,"
and we can go to explain.

76
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:40,850
42 is a fine number, it's short,

77
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:43,290
but that's the default
that they have right now.

78
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:45,250
Some place between 30 and 90 days.

79
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:46,660
If it's for your home network,

80
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:48,720
90 days is sufficient and will have you

81
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,170
changing it often enough.

82
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,110
You can actually change this

83
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:55,210
anywhere between one and 999 days.

84
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:57,830
You can also set it so
that it never expires.

85
00:02:57,830 --> 00:02:59,840
I do not recommend doing that.

86
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,350
And our final setting is password history.

87
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:04,150
This means how many passwords will

88
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:07,210
Windows remember and
not let you use again?

89
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:09,920
For example, let's say my
password was "password,"

90
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,847
and then I change it to "password1"

91
00:03:11,847 --> 00:03:13,290
and then I change it to "password2."

92
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:15,650
That is three different
passwords I've used.

93
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:17,540
So if I set that to three,

94
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:21,427
I would then have to make
another one called "password3"

95
00:03:21,427 --> 00:03:24,000
before I could go back to the
original one of "password."

96
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,350
That's the idea here.

97
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:27,110
Generally in high security environments,

98
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:29,040
you want something like 24.

99
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,520
If you're in a lower security environment,

100
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,320
something like five would be fine.

101
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,260
Because, if you change it five times

102
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:35,938
and you're doing it every 90 days,

103
00:03:35,938 --> 00:03:38,740
you're going to go
about a year and a third

104
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:40,280
before you have to change it again,

105
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,690
or about a year and a half.

106
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:43,210
And if you go to the explanation again,

107
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:45,130
this gives you that same explanation.

108
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:46,580
If you have zero, that means you can

109
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:48,400
constantly reuse the same password.

110
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,910
So if I require you to change
your password every 90 days,

111
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:52,740
but I left the password history at zero,

112
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:53,890
guess what I can do?

113
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:56,350
Change my password to the same password.

114
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:58,580
And that resets the 90
day clock and go again.

115
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:00,380
Not a very good thing for security.

116
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:03,010
So now you understand some
of the basic group policies

117
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:05,970
that you can set inside
here for your passwords.

118
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:08,960
And something like this
is a fairly adequate setup

119
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:11,080
for a small or medium size business.

120
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,500
If you want to make it more secure,

121
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:15,740
you can do that by
minimizing the password age,

122
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:18,070
take that down to 30 days, maybe,

123
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:20,100
and maximizing your password history.

124
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:22,140
Something more like 24.

125
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:24,020
So that's the idea here when you're using

126
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:25,690
your local group policy editor.

127
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:27,070
If you're doing this on a domain,

128
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:29,040
you can then take that
and push this policy out

129
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,020
to every single computer on the domain

130
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,470
and they'll a ll have to follow your

131
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:34,663
new strong password policy.

132
00:04:34,663 --> 00:04:37,027
