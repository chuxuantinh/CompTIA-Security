1
00:00:00,481 --> 00:00:02,350
- Backdoors and logic bombs.

2
00:00:02,350 --> 00:00:05,300
A backdoor was originally
placed in computer programs

3
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:08,980
to bypass the normal security
and authentication functions.

4
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:11,460
Now, if this sounds like
a horrible idea to you,

5
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:14,550
it really is, and it's a
horrible security practice.

6
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:16,360
This is something that
was originally created

7
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:19,230
back in the 80's, by
manufacturers and programmers

8
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:21,340
as a way for them to
get back into the system

9
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:22,820
to do maintenance and repairs,

10
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:24,865
without having to go through
all the authentications

11
00:00:24,865 --> 00:00:25,970
and going through the firewalls

12
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:27,890
and the layers of security that they would

13
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:29,980
if they went in the front door.

14
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:32,510
Now, this is a horrible and bad practice,

15
00:00:32,510 --> 00:00:34,920
and it should not be
used in current networks.

16
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:37,180
And these days, it's
actually considered a breach

17
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:39,390
of good, secure coding practices.

18
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:41,560
But, back in the 80's and the 90's,

19
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:44,200
and even into the early 2000's,

20
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,700
backdoors were a commonplace thing

21
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:47,520
that were put in by programmers.

22
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,980
Now these days, most software
does not have a backdoor.

23
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:52,880
It's been patched up and cleared up

24
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:55,340
because they know how bad
these are for security.

25
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:58,390
But, there is something that
acts just like a backdoor.

26
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:00,460
What do you think that might be?

27
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:03,030
Well, it's a remote access trojan.

28
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:05,900
A remote access trojan can
be placed by an attacker

29
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:08,920
to maintain their persistent
access to your system.

30
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,860
So if I'm able to trick you into clicking

31
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:13,480
a spearfishing link, and
then you install malware

32
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:15,140
based on clicking that link,

33
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:17,780
now I have something that
can make a call back to me.

34
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:20,130
That can give me that remote access.

35
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:23,370
I have a way to bypass your
system's natural security

36
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:25,090
and use that remote access trojan

37
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:27,410
as a backdoor, to gain
access to your system

38
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:29,330
anytime I want.

39
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:31,620
Another insecure coding
practice that was used by

40
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:34,980
programmers is what we
refer to as an Easter Egg.

41
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:37,400
An Easter Egg would be
placed in the code as a joke

42
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,200
or a form of gag gift.

43
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,250
Essentially, there would
be different things

44
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:43,040
that would happen in
different video games,

45
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,650
or different pieces of software

46
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:46,810
when certain code was executed.

47
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:50,150
For example, a few years ago,
you could go to Google.com

48
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:52,070
and type in do a barrel roll,

49
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:55,080
and the whole page would
do a 360 degree rotation

50
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,820
as if it was doing a
barrel roll in an airplane.

51
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:59,790
There was no real function to doing that

52
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:02,140
except it was a joke, it was a gag.

53
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:04,100
It was a joke that Google
programmers decided

54
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:05,380
to put into the code.

55
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:07,150
That's a form of an Easter Egg.

56
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:09,170
Now, Easter Eggs are generally harmless

57
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:10,680
but they do add additional code,

58
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,700
that can have additional vulnerabilities.

59
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:14,730
The reason for this is because their code,

60
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:17,600
because it's a joke, is usually
put in at the last minute

61
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:21,010
and it doesn't undergo
rigorous security testing.

62
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:24,150
Now, why am I talking about
Easter Eggs in this lesson?

63
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:25,610
Well, it's because it brings us up

64
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:27,670
to the subject of logic bombs.

65
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:30,610
Logic bombs are a descendant
of those earlier Easter Eggs.

66
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:34,370
But logic bombs were designed
with malicious intent in mind.

67
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:36,160
Logic bombs are malicious code

68
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,970
that's inserted into a program,

69
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:40,180
and it will execute only
when certain conditions

70
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:41,330
have been met.

71
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:43,440
For example, a disgruntled employee

72
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,120
may insert a logic bomb
into the server's code

73
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,440
so that if that employee
isn't on the payroll anymore,

74
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:51,710
a bad action, like deleting
all the files, could occur.

75
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:53,870
One of my favorite
examples of a logic bomb

76
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:56,260
actually comes from the
movie Jurassic Park.

77
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:57,950
In the movie, the park's programmer,

78
00:02:57,950 --> 00:03:00,560
Dennis Nedry, decides he's
going to put a logic bomb

79
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,090
into the power grid system,

80
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:04,340
so that it will go off at a certain time.

81
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:06,680
He does this so that when
the power gets turned off

82
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:09,290
by the logic bomb, he's able
to sneak out of the room,

83
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:11,620
go past all the alarms
and get into the nursery

84
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:13,740
and steal some of the dinosaur embryos.

85
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:16,110
He thinks he's going to get
off and sell those embryos

86
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:17,300
and become a millionaire.

87
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:19,160
Of course, it goes bad for him because

88
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,040
dinosaurs are running rampant in the park

89
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,900
because he turned off the electrical grid

90
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:24,340
and he doesn't make it.

91
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:26,270
But that's an example of a logic bomb.

92
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:28,300
He set it up so at a certain time,

93
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:31,610
a certain action would happen
and it had malicious intent.

94
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:34,380
Now, logic bombs and
Easter Eggs and backdoors

95
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,150
are all things that should not be found

96
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:37,510
inside our code.

97
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:40,010
These all go against our
secure coding standards

98
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:42,500
and best practices, so
you want to make sure

99
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:45,250
that none of this is
existing in your server code,

100
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:47,070
to make sure that you have the most secure

101
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:48,323
network that you can.
