1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:02,980
- In this lesson, we're going
to discuss the use of RAIDS

2
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:04,900
to ensure your data redundancy.

3
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:06,060
You first learned about RAIDS

4
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:08,250
all the way back in your A plus studies.

5
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:10,440
If you remember a RAID
is a redundant array

6
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:11,920
of independent disks

7
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:13,170
which is essentially going to allow you

8
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:15,340
to combine multiple physical hard disks

9
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:17,580
into a single logical hard disk drive

10
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:19,650
inside of the operating system.

11
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:21,530
Now, for the security plus exam

12
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:23,580
you need to know about
a couple of RAID types

13
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:28,323
including; RAID 0, RAID 1,
RAID 5, RAID 6 and RAID 10.

14
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:32,410
A RAID 0 provides data
striping across multiple disks

15
00:00:32,410 --> 00:00:34,490
and is used to increase your performance.

16
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:36,390
The key word here is striping.

17
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:38,620
For example, you might use a RAID 0

18
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:40,610
when you need performance,
but you don't care about

19
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:42,960
fault tolerance, so a
good example of this is

20
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,510
I do a lot of video editing
and so I really care about

21
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:48,150
performance there as I'm
editing these raw videos

22
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:50,270
and so by having these two
drives working together,

23
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:51,920
I can do things much quicker

24
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,630
than I could with a single drive.

25
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:56,620
Now to do a RAID 0, you
do need at least two disks

26
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:58,600
to work in tandem with each other.

27
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,510
The next one we have is a RAID 1

28
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:02,060
and this is going to provide redundancy

29
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:05,230
by mirroring the data
identically to two hard drives.

30
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:06,590
So if one drive fails,

31
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:08,080
the other can continue to operate

32
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:11,050
because it has a full copy of
everything that was on there.

33
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:13,040
This provides the least amount of downtime

34
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,150
because there is always
that complete copy of data

35
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:17,310
ready at a moment's notice to take over.

36
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:19,310
This provides wonderful fault tolerance,

37
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:21,800
but it can it can only be used
with two physical hard disks

38
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:24,910
and that provide you with
one single logical hard disk

39
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:26,690
inside the operating system.

40
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:28,490
A good example of this
is once I'm finished

41
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:29,750
editing all my videos

42
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:31,040
and I have the final the final product,

43
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,510
I want to make sure I don't lose it,

44
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:35,060
so I can actually move
that over to a RAID 1

45
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:37,130
where I get two identical
copies of that file

46
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:39,220
one on each of those drives.

47
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:41,950
Now, the next one we're going
to talk about is a RAID 5.

48
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:45,150
A RAID 5 is known as a
striping disk with parity.

49
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:48,494
It requires at least three
physical disk drives to work,

50
00:01:48,494 --> 00:01:49,327
and it provides fault tolerance

51
00:01:49,327 --> 00:01:51,550
by striping the data across multiple disks

52
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:54,420
and writing parity data
to the multiple disks too.

53
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:57,530
If one disk fails, the other
two can reconstruct the data

54
00:01:57,530 --> 00:02:00,400
based on the parity and
they continue to operate.

55
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,040
This means that if one
of those drives fails,

56
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,150
I can pull it out,

57
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:04,260
put in a new drive

58
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:06,570
and it will rebuild itself inside the RAID

59
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:09,130
as it keeps moving and operating
for the rest of the system.

60
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:10,650
Next, we have a RAID 6

61
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:13,810
and a RAID 6 is a
modified form of a RAID 5.

62
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:15,860
In fact, it's one better than a RAID 5

63
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:17,810
that's why we call it a RAID 6.

64
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:20,870
Now, it's going to use data
striping across multiple disks

65
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:22,350
just like a RAID 5 did,

66
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:24,810
but instead of having one
stripe for parity data,

67
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:27,770
it's actually going to have
two stripes for parity data.

68
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:30,030
This requires another
disk in the array to work

69
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:32,280
so you need at least four physical disks,

70
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,930
but that does provide you
additional fault tolerance

71
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:37,220
because you can lose up
to two of these four disks

72
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:39,850
and the RAID will still
continue to function.

73
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:42,920
The last RAID we have
is known as a RAID 1 0

74
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:45,110
which is written as RAID 10.

75
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:48,260
This combines the advantages
of a RAID 1 and a RAID 0

76
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:51,400
because one plus zero equals 10.

77
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:54,480
This requires four physical
disks just like a RAID 6

78
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,340
and it's going to provide
you with a redundant mirror

79
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:59,140
of striped drives and
its fully fault tolerant.

80
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:01,260
This gives us all the speed of a RAID 0

81
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:03,920
by splitting up the load
across two sets of RAIDs,

82
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,670
but it also gives us the
full redundancy of a RAID 1

83
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:09,030
by having those two RAID 1 in there.

84
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:12,000
Now, this all works as
one combined logical drive

85
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,980
even though it uses those four drives

86
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:16,100
split up into two pairs of two.

87
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:19,270
So, when we think of RAIDs,
they can be categorized as;

88
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:22,600
failure resistant, fault-tolerant
and disaster-tolerant.

89
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,830
These are our three categories for RAIDs.

90
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:26,700
Now, if you have a failure-resistant RAID,

91
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:29,530
that's going to be something
like a RAID 1 or a RAID 5 because

92
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:31,880
it's going to protect against
the loss of the array's data

93
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:34,210
if a single disk fails inside of it.

94
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:36,260
Now, we talk about
fault-tolerant disk systems,

95
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:38,750
this will be something like
a RAID 1 or a RAID 5 again,

96
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:42,360
or even RAID 6, because even
if a single component fails

97
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:45,200
one of those drives or even
one of the cards inside of it,

98
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,220
then that RAID can continue
to function properly.

99
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:50,960
Now, our final category is
known as disaster-tolerant,

100
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:53,240
and so if we call a
RAID disaster-tolerant,

101
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,540
this means that the RAIDs
has two independent zones

102
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:58,200
with full access to the data at all times.

103
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:01,640
A RAID 10 is a good example
of a disaster-tolerant RAID,

104
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,800
but so is a RAID 01.

105
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,750
A RAID 01? What's that?

106
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,890
Well, if I create this RAID 01,

107
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:09,290
I'm going to have a striped array

108
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:12,640
made up of two mirrored
RAID 1, and by doing this,

109
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,410
I could lose either half of the array

110
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:17,210
and one of those RAID 1 are
going to still function,

111
00:04:17,210 --> 00:04:19,520
and that means the system is
still going to keep functioning

112
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,250
and is going to make it disaster-tolerant

113
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:23,010
because I have a full copy of that data

114
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:25,170
ready to go at all times.

115
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:27,110
Now RAIDs are a great thing to use

116
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:29,080
when you're trying to
ensure you good redundancy

117
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:32,570
of your data, online and
available at all times.

118
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:34,460
This helps increase our
availability portion

119
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:37,450
of the CIA triad, and it
helps us when we're designing

120
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:39,808
a high availability system.

121
00:04:39,808 --> 00:04:42,115
(soft music)
