00:00:00,869 --> 00:00:02,110
- In this demonstration,

2
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:04,140
you're going to learn how
to create a software RAID

3
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:05,730
on a Windows machine.

4
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:07,610
My machine has a few hard drives,

5
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:08,880
and we're going to go ahead and use

6
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,089
the Windows disk management tool

7
00:00:10,089 --> 00:00:12,340
to setup two different RAID systems on it.

8
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:14,380
Now, one is going to be a RAID 0,

9
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:16,990
which is going to provide us
with more speed and performance

10
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:18,960
by splitting the data
being read and write,

11
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,800
into to two separate drives
on two different disks.

12
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,100
Now, each disk is going
to get half of the data.

13
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:25,760
This means, if I lose one of the drives,

14
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,569
I'm going to lose all of the data.

15
00:00:27,569 --> 00:00:30,853
Now, on the other hand, I'm
going to create a second RAID.

16
00:00:31,828 --> 00:00:32,661
This is going to be a RAID 1,

17
00:00:32,661 --> 00:00:34,310
which allows us to have two hard disks

18
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:35,750
operating in a mirror.

19
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:38,569
So, both disks are going to have
exactly the same data on 'em.

20
00:00:38,569 --> 00:00:40,930
This means I'm not going to
get the performance boost

21
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:42,240
I get with a RAID 0,

22
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,840
but I do get redundancy.

23
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:44,860
So, if one disk fails,

24
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:47,070
the other disk is still
going to be maintaining

25
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:49,046
a fully online and ready to use copy

26
00:00:49,046 --> 00:00:51,129
of all of the data and information.

27
00:00:51,129 --> 00:00:53,590
Now, let's go ahead and jump into the lab,

28
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:56,490
and let me show you how to
create these two types of RAIDs.

29
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:58,040
So, on this Windows 10 machine,

30
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:59,270
I current have a C drive

31
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:00,900
with the operating system installed,

32
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:03,490
and I have four blank disks
that have been installed.

33
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:04,887
I'm going to go ahead and
go to my disk management,

34
00:01:04,887 --> 00:01:07,890
and inside my disk management,
under computer management,

35
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:10,680
you will see that I have four
disks that are brand new.

36
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,467
I'm going to go ahead
and initialize those.

37
00:01:12,467 --> 00:01:14,830
Now that I've initialized them,

38
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:16,918
I have these four unallocated disks

39
00:01:16,918 --> 00:01:20,760
sitting here at the bottom,
and my current C drive.

40
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,000
So, what I want to do is,

41
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,340
I want to create two different RAIDs.

42
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:26,320
I'm going to create one for video editing,

43
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,188
which means I want
performance over redundancy.

44
00:01:29,188 --> 00:01:30,240
So, what I'm going to do is,

45
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,100
I'm going to right click on my first disk,

46
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:34,370
and go to new striped volume.

47
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:37,068
Because, I'm going to stripe
across disk one and disk two

48
00:01:37,068 --> 00:01:40,490
to make my RAID 0, to give
me that performance I want.

49
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:41,900
As I walk through the wizard,

50
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:43,520
I'm going to add the second disk to it.

51
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,929
So, I have disk one and disk two,

52
00:01:44,929 --> 00:01:47,660
then I'm going to go down next,

53
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:49,070
I'm going to give it a drive letter.

54
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:51,960
In this case, I'm just going to
go ahead and call it drive D.

55
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:52,793
Hit next.

56
00:01:52,793 --> 00:01:53,740
I'm going to give it a name.

57
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:54,790
I'm going to call it editing,

58
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:56,590
because I'm going to use
it for video editing.

59
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:58,110
And then, I'll hit next.

60
00:01:58,110 --> 00:01:59,490
And then, we'll finish.

61
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:01,010
And, we'll say yes,

62
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:01,860
and off it goes.

63
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:06,860
I now have, drive D,
which is 1.57 terabytes,

64
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:08,260
and I have 100% free,

65
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:10,790
because I have two, 800 gigabyte drives

66
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:13,060
working in tandem to give me

67
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:15,960
that one, logical drive, drive D.

68
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:18,060
But, if either of those disks fails,

69
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:19,780
drive D will be gone.

70
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:22,320
Now, let's go ahead and
create a redundant drive,

71
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,250
which is going to be drive three and four.

72
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:27,060
I'm going to add them
together as a mirrored volume.

73
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:28,649
Now, when I add both of those in,

74
00:02:28,649 --> 00:02:30,550
I'm going to get two disks,

75
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:33,330
but I'm only going to get
one disk's worth of space.

76
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:35,238
I'm going to call this R for redundancy.

77
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:39,543
And so, over here for R, I'm
going to call it redundant,

78
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,090
and we'll go ahead and format it.

79
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:47,080
And notice, I now have
this redundant drive,

80
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,868
which is called drive R.

81
00:02:48,868 --> 00:02:51,860
And, drive R is a mirrored drive,

82
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:53,200
it is going to be dynamic.

83
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,760
And you'll notice that it
only has a capacity size

84
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,410
of one of those drives,

85
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:58,746
because one is acting as primary

86
00:02:58,746 --> 00:03:01,840
and one is acting as
backup, where both of them

87
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,550
have the exact same information.

88
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:05,089
And, if either of them goes offline,

89
00:03:05,089 --> 00:03:07,970
the other drive will still take over.

90
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:09,950
That gives me my fault tolerance,

91
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:12,460
and that creates a 50% overhead,

92
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:15,100
or a loss of one drive's worth of space.

93
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:16,638
But, that's the sacrifice.

94
00:03:16,638 --> 00:03:19,890
Do you want performance,
and double the space?

95
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:23,260
Or, do you want redundancy,
and half the space?

96
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:25,160
That's the choice that we're making here.

97
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,790
Now, in my case I chose both.

98
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:28,730
I wanted one drive as my scratch drive

99
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:29,690
for all my video editing,

100
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:31,640
and I wanted my redundant drive to be

101
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,270
where I store the finished products,

102
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:36,238
and it gives me that redundancy
that I was looking for.

103
