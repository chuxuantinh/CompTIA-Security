00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:01,950
- Insider threat.

2
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:04,190
What is an insider threat?

3
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:06,730
In my opinion, an insider
threat is probably one

4
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:09,371
of the worst and most dangerous things

5
00:00:09,371 --> 00:00:11,790
to your organization.

6
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:13,680
An insider threat is
simply somebody who works

7
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,220
for your organization, but
they have ulterior motives

8
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:19,050
and they want to do something
negative to your organization.

9
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:21,130
For example, let's say that I hired you on

10
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:23,830
to be my employee and you
decide to come work for me.

11
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:26,610
The first thing I'm going to
do is give you account access.

12
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:28,470
So I give you a username and password.

13
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:31,210
Now your a standard user, but
you can log on to our network,

14
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:33,500
you can access our files
and our shared drive,

15
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:34,630
the ones that you have permissions to,

16
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:37,140
and you can send emails
and you can go on the web

17
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:38,860
and those type of things, right?

18
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:40,250
Well, let's say that you build up trust

19
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:42,110
in my organization for
about three to six months

20
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:44,500
and I give you more and more
access to different things

21
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,710
throughout our organization
that you need access to.

22
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:48,480
You have access to maybe
all of our slide decks

23
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,700
and all of our videos and
all that kind of stuff.

24
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:53,580
Well, if you took all that
data, copied it for yourself

25
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:55,220
and then gave it to my competitors,

26
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:57,530
you would be an insider
threat in that case, right?

27
00:00:57,530 --> 00:00:59,330
Because you've stolen
the information from us

28
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:01,070
and given it out to other people.

29
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:03,360
That is why insiders are so dangerous,

30
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,870
because they're hard to detect,

31
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:06,760
because they already have
authorized permissions

32
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:09,520
on the network to access
those files and folders.

33
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,400
Now, if you're an insider threat,

34
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,070
you might also decide
to download something

35
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:15,550
like a key logger or some
kind of malicious software

36
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:17,970
that can go around and collect
data throughout the network.

37
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:21,140
Again, as somebody who is
authenticated and trusted

38
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:22,520
on the inside of the network,

39
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:24,040
we're not necessarily looking for you,

40
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,220
we're looking for bad guys trying

41
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:26,520
to break in at the boundary

42
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,460
and a lot of times, we
forget about those people

43
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:31,810
inside our walls already that
are doing things against us.

44
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:33,420
And so, when you think about this

45
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:34,860
from a security perspective,

46
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:36,610
you need to think not just of the bad guy

47
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:39,260
who's outside your walls
trying to break in,

48
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:40,990
but you also need to
think about those people

49
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:43,480
who you trust, those employees you have

50
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,120
because they may not be working

51
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,590
with your best interests at heart.

52
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:48,250
And so you have to keep an eye on that

53
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:50,220
and there's lots of ways to do that.

54
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:53,230
One of the ways we talked
about before was DLP.

55
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:54,910
Data Loss Protection, right?

56
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:57,380
You install Data Loss Protection
and it will keep track

57
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:59,940
of all the files that are
being copied and downloaded

58
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:01,570
so you can go back and figure out,

59
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:03,540
was that person really stealing from you

60
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,360
or were they just doing their job?

61
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,290
That's the idea with an insider threat

62
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:08,600
and it's something you need to be aware of

63
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,223
as a good security professional.
