1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:02,520
- The three A's of security.

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:05,170
The three A's of security
are authentication,

3
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:07,290
authorization, and accounting.

4
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:08,580
Authentication occurs

5
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:11,020
when a person's identity
is established with proof

6
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:12,850
and is confirmed by the system.

7
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:14,530
You do this every single day.

8
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:17,200
In fact, you did it when
you logged into this course.

9
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:19,700
When you entered in your email
address and your password,

10
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:20,780
you're making a claim

11
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:23,010
that you are the student
who paid for this course.

12
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:25,040
And by doing that, you're
checked by the system

13
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:26,530
and granted access.

14
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:29,690
Now, there are different ways
to authenticate who you are.

15
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:31,050
In the real world, for example,

16
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:33,730
if you get pulled over for
speeding by a police officer,

17
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:35,340
you may pull out your driver's license

18
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:37,230
and show them that it is you

19
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:39,150
and that you are who you say you are.

20
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:40,570
This is your proof.

21
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:41,950
Now, in the digital world,

22
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:44,350
we have five methods of authentication.

23
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:45,660
We have something you know,

24
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:48,400
which would be something like
a password or a username.

25
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:49,980
We have something that you are,

26
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:51,460
which would be something
like your fingerprint

27
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:53,750
or an eye scan, or an retina scan.

28
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:55,120
We have something you have.

29
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,450
This would be something like a token,

30
00:00:56,450 --> 00:00:58,790
a driver's license, or a credit card.

31
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:00,230
It could be something you do,

32
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:01,480
which is the way that you speak

33
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:03,380
or the way that you sign your name.

34
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:05,340
And it can be somewhere you are,

35
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:07,200
which we know as your location factor

36
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,290
based on your GPS location.

37
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:11,820
Now, we're going to talk about
each of those five factors

38
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:15,080
in much more depth when we get
to our authentication lesson

39
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:17,000
later on in this course.

40
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,510
The second A is authorization.

41
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:22,140
Authorization occurs when
a user is given access

42
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:23,760
to a certain piece of data

43
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:26,140
or certain areas of the building.

44
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:27,570
Have you ever walked into a building

45
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:29,890
and saw a sign that
said restricted access,

46
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:31,700
authorized personnel only?

47
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:34,330
Well, that means you
can't go in that area.

48
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:36,240
It may be something
like a maintenance room

49
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,000
or some place where they have generators

50
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,940
and only the mechanics can get in there.

51
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:41,810
They have special keys or special badges

52
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:43,620
that will let them into those areas.

53
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:47,060
That area is some place you
are not authorized to go.

54
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:48,930
The third A is accounting.

55
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:51,130
Accounting ensures that tracking of data,

56
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:54,380
computer usage, and network
resources is maintained.

57
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:55,620
Now, when we do that,

58
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:58,300
it's usually put in
something called a log file.

59
00:01:58,300 --> 00:01:59,820
This is a file on a computer

60
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:02,080
that's essentially just
a large text document.

61
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,600
And it keeps track of all sorts of things.

62
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,490
This may be all of the
internet connections

63
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:07,510
that are leaving the network,

64
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:09,110
as shown here on the screen.

65
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:11,280
Or it may be a list of all of the people

66
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,810
who tried to log on to a
particular file or website.

67
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:17,450
All sorts of different logs
are kept on your computer

68
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:19,330
to keep track of all of the various things

69
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:20,260
that are being done.

70
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:23,100
And this is all to ensure
good accounting practices

71
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:24,390
are being used.

72
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:26,300
Because if you have a data breach,

73
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:28,410
or you have some kind
of an insider threat,

74
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:31,250
you can go back and look at
the data in your log files

75
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:34,040
to figure out who did what and when.

76
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,470
That's what accounting allows you to do.

77
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:39,270
Now, if you have proof that
somebody did something,

78
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:40,580
that they took an action,

79
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:43,150
we cal this non-repudiation.

80
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:45,960
Non-repudiation simply
means the user can't say

81
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,310
they didn't take the action

82
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:49,200
because you have proof they did.

83
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,280
For example, if you sent an email to me,

84
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,340
and you signed it with
a digital signature,

85
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,480
you're the only person in the whole world

86
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:58,050
who has that private
digital signature key.

87
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:00,530
I know for sure that you sent that email.

88
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:02,500
You can't tell me later
that you didn't send it

89
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,200
because now I have proof.

90
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,960
That's non-repudiation.

91
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:08,605
(upbeat music)
