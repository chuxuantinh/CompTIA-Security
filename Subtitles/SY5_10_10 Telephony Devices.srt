1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:02,270
- Telephony devices.

2
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:04,530
Telephony is a term
that's used for a device

3
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:07,660
that provides voice
communication to your end users.

4
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:10,120
Originally, telephony was used in networks

5
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:12,240
to make connections with the outside world

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,790
such us through your modem.

7
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:16,590
So a modem was this old
device that we used to use

8
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:18,840
that would allow us to
modulate and demodulate

9
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:21,200
digital information into an analog signal

10
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:24,030
that could transmit over a
standard dial-up connection.

11
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:26,190
So if you used AOL as a dial-up connection

12
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:27,320
way back in the day,

13
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:29,540
you would put your phone
line into your computer,

14
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:31,300
it would take your ones and zeros,

15
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:33,520
convert them into signals of sound

16
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,820
and transmit that over the phone line.

17
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:38,500
Now, modems were a great
attack vector though

18
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:39,920
from the security perspective.

19
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,480
And for the Security Plus exam,

20
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:44,040
you need to know the
concept of war dialing.

21
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:46,120
War dialing is simply when an attacker

22
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,860
starts dialing random phone numbers

23
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:50,910
to see if any modems would
answer on the other side.

24
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:52,760
So a lot of servers back in those days

25
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,320
will have dial-up modems

26
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,860
so that remote technicians
could dial into the server,

27
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:59,650
gain access and make
changes to due support.

28
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:00,970
Well, if I was an attacker

29
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:04,840
and I started dialing random
numbers like 555-1234,

30
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:05,673
nobody there.

31
00:01:05,673 --> 00:01:09,180
555-1235 and just keep adding numbers,

32
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:11,800
eventually, I'll find
some server that answers.

33
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:14,960
And if they do, I now have
a way into that network.

34
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,510
So how do we protect modems in our systems

35
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:19,750
for any dialog resources that we may have

36
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:21,780
from this type of thing like war dialing?

37
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:23,260
Well, one of the main things to do

38
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:25,170
is use a callback feature.

39
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:27,380
If you still have modems,
which most of us don't

40
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:29,520
in our networks anymore, but if you do,

41
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,410
you want to make them set so
that when somebody calls in,

42
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:34,020
they would then hang up

43
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:35,900
and the modem, if it
recognize that phone number

44
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:38,330
based on caller ID will
then call them back

45
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:39,810
and initiate the connection.

46
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:42,510
This will verify that the person
is who they think they are

47
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:43,930
and who they say they are.

48
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:46,560
Now, you always want to also
use some form of authentication,

49
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,110
like a username or password.

50
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:50,490
But preferably, you want to
use something more complex

51
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:53,470
like two factor or
multi-factor authentication.

52
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:56,110
The best practice though is to
do what most of us have done,

53
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:58,530
and that's eliminate modems where possible

54
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:00,010
and switch to remote access

55
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:04,040
to using things like an SSH
connection over VPN tunnels.

56
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,350
Now, while it's great to try
to eliminate all your modems,

57
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:08,320
sometimes, you still have old systems

58
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,050
and you simply can't do that.

59
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:12,690
If you have to maintain a
dial-up modem for some reason,

60
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:15,470
you want to make sure you keep
that dial-up number a secret.

61
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:17,030
And so somebody's going
to have to work hard

62
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:18,040
to be able to find it

63
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,700
and be able to get into your system.

64
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:21,460
Again, if you have a dial-up modem,

65
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:23,040
you want to use good authentication.

66
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,760
You want to be able to use
things that will help prevent it

67
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:27,210
like callbacks and other
things to help secure it,

68
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:29,770
because these are prime
targets for attackers.

69
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:32,190
Now, the next type of telephony
equipment I want to talk about

70
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:33,760
is a PBX system.

71
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,530
A PBX equipment is something
you're going to find

72
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:37,160
much more often in your networks

73
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,810
than you are going to find modems.

74
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:42,100
A PBX system stands for
a Public Branch Exchange.

75
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:44,410
Essentially, this is the telephone system

76
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:47,730
that runs all of the internal
phone lines for your company.

77
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:49,040
If you're sitting in your office

78
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,580
and you want to call your
accountant inside the office

79
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:53,500
and you dial the last four
digits of his phone number

80
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,750
only to get him, that internal call

81
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:57,870
is being routed through your PBX system,

82
00:02:57,870 --> 00:02:59,940
through that public branch exchange.

83
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:03,000
Now, attackers like to
target PBX systems too,

84
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,560
and it's not necessarily to
try to break into the system

85
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,290
and be able to get information out of us,

86
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:10,570
but instead, it's because they
want to get free long distance.

87
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:12,170
Now, some of us use our cellphones

88
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:14,940
and we get free calling across
the entire United States.

89
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:17,110
So long distance doesn't
seem like a big deal.

90
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:18,770
But, if you want to start placing calls

91
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:20,250
all the way around the world,

92
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:22,190
and you can break in to
somebody's PBX system,

93
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:24,530
they're going to get the
bill for it and you're not.

94
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:26,550
So that's why attacker would do this.

95
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:28,730
Now, how do you secure your PBX system?

96
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:30,010
Well, one of the best ways

97
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:32,380
is to actually mount it in a locked room

98
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:34,210
inside your telephone area.

99
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:35,360
By putting it in a locked room,

100
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,120
it means only authorized
maintenance technicians

101
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,530
can get into it and touch the system.

102
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:44,020
Also, you want to disable
any remote access to that PBX

103
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:45,370
and any remote access ports

104
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:47,050
because again, that's where attackers

105
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:50,370
are most commonly going to
be accessing your PBX from.

106
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:53,870
Now, well, PBX systems are
still fairly common in industry.

107
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:56,210
They are getting replaced in large numbers

108
00:03:56,210 --> 00:03:57,810
in favor of VOIP.

109
00:03:57,810 --> 00:03:58,710
What is VOIP?

110
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:01,340
Well, it's Voice Over Internet Protocol.

111
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:04,230
VOIP is much cheaper than
the traditional PBX system

112
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:06,470
and it's a lot more
secure and easier to run

113
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:08,320
if you can figure it properly.

114
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,900
Some organizations will actually run

115
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,420
two different networks now.

116
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:13,820
One for data and one for the VOIP network.

117
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:15,390
And this will allow
them to be able to have

118
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:17,590
two separate networks that
gives you more security.

119
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:18,980
But a lot of organizations

120
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:20,800
try to take the easy or cheaper way

121
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,630
of combining them both onto
a single combined network.

122
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:25,060
And now you have VOIP devices

123
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:27,630
sharing the network the
data devices are onto

124
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:29,000
like your computers.

125
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,630
Now, if you do this, you want to make sure

126
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:32,300
you put at least the VOIP devices

127
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:34,800
on their own VLAN and their own subnets

128
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,630
to help create some of that separation

129
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:38,840
and segmentation we talked about earlier.

130
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:41,610
Now, VOIP works by relying on IP phones,

131
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:43,900
software, and VOIP gateways.

132
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,870
An IP phone is simply a physical device

133
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:47,480
that looks like a regular telephone

134
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,290
but takes a network cable into it

135
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:50,930
as opposed to a phone cable.

136
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:53,060
This thing connects back
to the VOIP gateway,

137
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:55,260
which will make the conversation happen

138
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:57,120
between your phone and
the remote destination

139
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,450
that you're trying to call.

140
00:04:58,450 --> 00:04:59,930
To secure VOIP devices,

141
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:01,720
you want to update the device's firmware

142
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:04,280
because these IP phones
are devices afterall,

143
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,690
and they do get firmware updates

144
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:07,090
that have patches and security

145
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:08,260
when they've been hacked.

146
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:10,560
You also want to make sure
you're using good authentication,

147
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,970
good encryption to make sure
maintaining the integrity

148
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:15,820
and confidentiality of the
phone calls you're making

149
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:18,500
between your VOIP device, the VOIP gateway

150
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,490
and then the remove destination.

151
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:23,140
Availability is another
concern you have with VOIP.

152
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:24,100
When you're dealing with VOIP

153
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:26,160
and we talked about this
back in network plus,

154
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,300
you have to make sure implementing
good quality of service.

155
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:31,400
This isn't as much a security concern,

156
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:34,500
but because availability
is part of the CIA triad,

157
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,960
we do want to be keeping
that in mind as well.

158
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,030
VOIP takes a lot of bandwidth

159
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:40,100
and it takes a lot of
good quality of service,

160
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:43,510
meaning it needs a short delay
inside the communications.

161
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:45,770
Otherwise, your phone
calls don't sound good.

162
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:48,320
And that can become leading
to a denial of service.

163
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,710
And so making sure that you have

164
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:51,320
the proper quality of service

165
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,490
put into your networks

166
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:53,640
will your allow your VOIP devices

167
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,210
to communicate more securely,

168
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:57,853
more quickly, and have
better availability.
