1
00:00:00,155 --> 00:00:03,239
- In this demonstration, I'm
going to show you how to use

2
00:00:03,239 --> 00:00:05,424
the Local Group Policy editor to set up

3
00:00:05,424 --> 00:00:08,098
some various configurations
for your machine.

4
00:00:08,098 --> 00:00:10,514
We're going to use a
Windows 10 workstation here

5
00:00:10,514 --> 00:00:13,012
as our example machine,
and we're going to go

6
00:00:13,012 --> 00:00:14,690
and do an application whitelist and

7
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:18,836
an application blacklist
using the Group Policy Editor.

8
00:00:18,836 --> 00:00:20,813
To access the Group Policy Editor,

9
00:00:20,813 --> 00:00:25,092
we simply need to go and
start up the GP Edit Program,

10
00:00:25,092 --> 00:00:27,982
so we'll go ahead and
use Edit Group Policy,

11
00:00:27,982 --> 00:00:31,680
and let me go ahead and make this larger.

12
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:33,439
And you'll see, down the left side,

13
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:35,026
all of the various configurations

14
00:00:35,026 --> 00:00:38,531
we can do on a per user
or per computer basis.

15
00:00:38,531 --> 00:00:40,612
We're going to start with
the per computer basis

16
00:00:40,612 --> 00:00:42,445
with Windows settings.

17
00:00:44,776 --> 00:00:48,174
Next, we're going to look
at the security settings.

18
00:00:48,174 --> 00:00:50,239
And under here, we have Account Policies,

19
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:52,041
which show our Password Policies,

20
00:00:52,041 --> 00:00:54,398
as well as Local Policies,
which will allow us

21
00:00:54,398 --> 00:00:57,471
to do auditing user rights
and security options.

22
00:00:57,471 --> 00:00:58,866
But what I want to focus on here

23
00:00:58,866 --> 00:01:00,903
is application control, so we go into

24
00:01:00,903 --> 00:01:03,022
our Application Control policies,

25
00:01:03,022 --> 00:01:06,646
which will allow us to create
whitelists and blacklists.

26
00:01:06,646 --> 00:01:08,179
If I go ahead and hit the down arrow,

27
00:01:08,179 --> 00:01:10,271
you'll see we have AppLocker.

28
00:01:10,271 --> 00:01:12,866
AppLocker will allow us
to create different rules

29
00:01:12,866 --> 00:01:15,802
for installers, for
scripts, for packaged apps,

30
00:01:15,802 --> 00:01:17,380
and what we're going to use right now,

31
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:20,139
which is Executable Rules.

32
00:01:20,139 --> 00:01:22,839
Underneath the Executable
Rules, you will see

33
00:01:22,839 --> 00:01:24,836
we currently have no items listed,

34
00:01:24,836 --> 00:01:26,881
because this is a brand new computer.

35
00:01:26,881 --> 00:01:28,823
I'm going to create a whitelist here

36
00:01:28,823 --> 00:01:32,126
and allow a certain application to be run.

37
00:01:32,126 --> 00:01:37,126
To do that, we simply right
click and create a new rule.

38
00:01:37,504 --> 00:01:41,192
From here, we're going to be
able to walk through the Wizard

39
00:01:41,192 --> 00:01:42,492
and you'll set up your permissions.

40
00:01:42,492 --> 00:01:44,074
Is this going to be an Allow Rule,

41
00:01:44,074 --> 00:01:45,782
meaning it's a whitelist rule,

42
00:01:45,782 --> 00:01:48,480
or a Deny rule, meaning
it's a blacklist rule.

43
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,683
In my case, I'm going
to create a Deny Rule,

44
00:01:50,683 --> 00:01:53,635
and I'm going to blacklist a program.

45
00:01:53,635 --> 00:01:55,104
Next, we're going to say what conditions

46
00:01:55,104 --> 00:01:56,186
are going to be met.

47
00:01:56,186 --> 00:01:57,863
Is it based on the person who wrote it,

48
00:01:57,863 --> 00:01:59,135
the publisher?

49
00:01:59,135 --> 00:02:00,854
Like I can block all
programs that were made

50
00:02:00,854 --> 00:02:04,803
by Microsoft, or by Adobe, if I wanted to.

51
00:02:04,803 --> 00:02:08,104
Or, is it based on path, a
certain file and folder name?

52
00:02:08,104 --> 00:02:10,020
Or, if it's a piece of malware,

53
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:12,174
you might want to do it
based on a file hash,

54
00:02:12,174 --> 00:02:14,504
because every file has
its own unique hash,

55
00:02:14,504 --> 00:02:18,157
as we'll talk about when we
get to hashes in cryptography.

56
00:02:18,157 --> 00:02:19,985
For right now, I'm going
to use the path option

57
00:02:19,985 --> 00:02:23,075
just to show you how this
works for an example.

58
00:02:23,075 --> 00:02:25,269
Next, we're going to find that file.

59
00:02:25,269 --> 00:02:27,647
You can browse and you
can block things based on

60
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:31,120
the folder it sits in
or a particular file.

61
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,258
For example, I might
want to make it so that

62
00:02:33,258 --> 00:02:35,734
nobody can run any files out of the

63
00:02:35,734 --> 00:02:38,707
C Drive and under the Temp folder,

64
00:02:38,707 --> 00:02:41,020
which is underneath the Windows folder.

65
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:43,931
So, if I go and click down there,

66
00:02:43,931 --> 00:02:45,795
I'll find the Temp folder,

67
00:02:45,795 --> 00:02:47,302
and then I'll hit "Okay".

68
00:02:47,302 --> 00:02:49,330
This says that anything
that's trying to be run

69
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:50,895
out of the Temporary directory

70
00:02:50,895 --> 00:02:52,995
is not going to be allowed.

71
00:02:52,995 --> 00:02:54,446
This is actually a good rule to set up

72
00:02:54,446 --> 00:02:56,385
because a lot of malware likes to try

73
00:02:56,385 --> 00:02:58,604
to run out of the Temp folder.

74
00:02:58,604 --> 00:02:59,864
Then we'll go ahead and click "Next",

75
00:02:59,864 --> 00:03:01,455
and you'll see that we have whatever

76
00:03:01,455 --> 00:03:02,990
exceptions we want to do.

77
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:05,395
Maybe I want to say that
I will allow nothing

78
00:03:05,395 --> 00:03:09,112
to run out of the Temp
folder except for Microsoft,

79
00:03:09,112 --> 00:03:10,625
and so I can actually browse through

80
00:03:10,625 --> 00:03:13,123
and find that reference
file for Microsoft.

81
00:03:13,123 --> 00:03:14,202
In my case, I'm going to block

82
00:03:14,202 --> 00:03:17,326
everything coming from that Temp folder.

83
00:03:17,326 --> 00:03:20,000
And, I'm going to give it a rule.

84
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
The rule name is going to
be "block files from running

85
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:26,696
out of temp directory."

86
00:03:26,696 --> 00:03:29,258
This is just used to give you a way

87
00:03:29,258 --> 00:03:31,743
to remember what that rule is used for,

88
00:03:31,743 --> 00:03:35,206
and you can now see that, by default,

89
00:03:35,206 --> 00:03:36,789
everyone is allowed

90
00:03:37,948 --> 00:03:40,319
to let anything run from
the Programs folder.

91
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:41,818
They can also allow
anything to be run from

92
00:03:41,818 --> 00:03:46,118
the Windows folder, and
they can allow all files.

93
00:03:46,118 --> 00:03:48,318
But, everyone is being blocked

94
00:03:48,318 --> 00:03:50,758
from running out of the Temp directory.

95
00:03:50,758 --> 00:03:53,470
That's the way we create
whitelist and blacklist rules.

96
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:55,600
In this example, I showed
you a blacklist rule,

97
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,359
but you can go through
and play around with it

98
00:03:57,359 --> 00:04:00,488
and do the exact same thing
to put whitelist rules

99
00:04:00,488 --> 00:04:02,558
where you would deny
everything by default,

100
00:04:02,558 --> 00:04:07,558
and only allow specific programs
and files that you specify.
