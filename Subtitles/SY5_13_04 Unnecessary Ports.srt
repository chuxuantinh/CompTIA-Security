1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:02,750
- Unnecessary ports.

2
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:05,070
As we've already discussed,
there are a lot of ports

3
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:07,880
available for use by your
computers and your networks.

4
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:11,850
We started out with 65,536 ports available

5
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:14,000
back in our ports and protocol lesson.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,170
Then, we narrowed it down to 35 ports

7
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:18,810
that you just had to
memorize in the last lesson.

8
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:20,630
But does that mean that all 35 of those

9
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:22,980
are necessary for your
computer to function?

10
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:24,870
Well, the answer is no.

11
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:25,840
When it comes down to it,

12
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,650
you aren't using all of those services,

13
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:29,340
at least not all of the time.

14
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:31,000
Also, if you're running a server,

15
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,640
you wouldn't want to have all
35 of those ports open either.

16
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:34,473
Why?

17
00:00:34,473 --> 00:00:36,770
Because many of them are unnecessary.

18
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:40,220
Now, that begs the question,
what makes a port unnecessary?

19
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:42,420
Well, an unnecessary port is simply one

20
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:44,690
that's associated with
a service or a function

21
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:47,290
that you don't need or is
considered non-essential.

22
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:49,410
For example, if you have
a server whose entire

23
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:51,850
function is to act as a mail relay server,

24
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:54,000
all it's designed to do is send mail out,

25
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,550
then the only thing it needs
is a couple of ports open.

26
00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:00,120
It needs port 25 for SMTP and port 465

27
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:04,210
or 587 for SMTP over SSL and TLS.

28
00:01:04,210 --> 00:01:05,620
Now, every other port on that server

29
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:08,590
can be shut or disabled or
closed and you wouldn't care,

30
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:11,010
because only those three
ports are the ones you need.

31
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:12,990
Remember, every open port represents

32
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:15,760
an unnecessary vulnerability
being left exposed

33
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,460
if you didn't need to have that port open.

34
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:20,040
So you want to close
anything you're not using.

35
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,770
Because of this, security professionals

36
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:24,060
and analysts routinely scan their servers,

37
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:26,100
their routers, and their
firewalls to ensure

38
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:27,690
that they understand exactly what ports

39
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:29,950
are open in their networks and which ones

40
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:31,860
they can disable or close.

41
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:34,310
For example, this is a
result from one of my scans

42
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:35,730
and you can see there's three hosts

43
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:39,660
that have ports 139 and
445 open in the network.

44
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:41,450
Now, thinking back to our last lesson

45
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:42,990
where you memorized all the ports,

46
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:44,700
can you guess which services these

47
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,210
machines might be running?

48
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:48,740
Well, port 139 is used for net bios

49
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:51,410
and port 445 is used for SMB.

50
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:53,700
This means these three
machines are most likely

51
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,270
running the Windows operating system

52
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:58,420
and they have file sharing
enabled over the local network.

53
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:00,140
Now, if these machines
don't need to have file

54
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:01,870
sharing enabled over the local network,

55
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:03,570
we can disable these ports and remove

56
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:05,570
the possible vulnerabilities
that are inherent

57
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:07,530
within the Windows file-sharing system.

58
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:09,000
To close an unnecessary port,

59
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,010
there are three methods you can use.

60
00:02:11,010 --> 00:02:13,610
First, you can stop the
service that uses that port

61
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:16,390
from the operating system's
graphical user interface.

62
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:18,350
To do that in Windows, simply open up

63
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:19,940
the computer management console,

64
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:21,790
select Services and Applications,

65
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:23,300
and then select Services.

66
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:24,620
From here, you double-click on

67
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:26,630
the particular service
that you want to turn off,

68
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:29,610
and it's going to open up
a dialog box as shown here.

69
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:31,240
Now, in this example, I've stopped

70
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,740
the Windows update service
in Windows 10 from running,

71
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:36,280
which will also prevent
any associated open ports

72
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:39,180
from remaining open because
of this service running.

73
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:40,510
The second method is to do this

74
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:42,050
from the command line interface.

75
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:43,020
As I showed you back in our

76
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:44,700
operating system hardening lessons,

77
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,120
you can turn off a service by using

78
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,750
the net stop command and
the name of the service.

79
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:50,270
On a Linux server, you can do this

80
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:52,670
by entering sudo stop and
the name of the service

81
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:54,230
at the command line.

82
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:55,450
Now, the third way to do this

83
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:57,470
is to block the ports at your firewall,

84
00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:00,140
whether this is a software
or hardware-based firewall,

85
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:01,780
or on the server itself.

86
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:04,550
Now, usually, a firewall's
going to block ports by default,

87
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:06,130
and it requires you to open the port

88
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:08,950
when you want to install a
particular service or function.

89
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:10,760
Now, for example, let's say you installed

90
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,410
the Apache web server at one point,

91
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:14,840
and this opened up port
80 on your firewall.

92
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,670
Now if you're no longer
running that web server,

93
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:18,140
you need to go back on that firewall

94
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:19,830
and close or disable that port

95
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:21,680
by blocking it in the firewall rules.
