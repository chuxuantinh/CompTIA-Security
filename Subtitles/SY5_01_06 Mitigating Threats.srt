1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,910
- There are three basic
categories that you can use

2
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:05,810
when you're mitigating
threats: physical controls,

3
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:08,363
technical controls, and
administrative controls.

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:11,250
Physical controls are those things

5
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:13,830
that you add into the
real world environment

6
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:15,880
to stop things from happening.

7
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:18,770
This might be an alarm
system, a surveillance camera,

8
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:22,500
locks, fences, doors,
identification cards,

9
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,920
badges, security guards,
all those type of things.

10
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,650
For example, you can see
here there's a security guard

11
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:31,180
who's monitoring the
closed circuit television.

12
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:33,120
If someone tries to
sneak into the building,

13
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,340
they should be able to see it

14
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:36,170
and they can go take action on it.

15
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:39,290
This would be a great example
of a physical control.

16
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:41,010
The second type of control we have is

17
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:43,050
what's called a technical control.

18
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:44,920
This would be things like smart cards,

19
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,820
access control lists,
intrusion detection systems,

20
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:50,430
encryption, and network authentication.

21
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:52,100
We have lots of technical controls,

22
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:55,040
and we'll talk about them a
lot throughout this course.

23
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,530
The third bucket we have is

24
00:00:56,530 --> 00:00:58,750
what's called administrative controls.

25
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:00,560
These are things like policies,

26
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:03,100
procedures, security awareness training,

27
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:06,390
contingency plans, and
disaster recovery plans.

28
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:09,140
Now, administrative controls
can further be broken down

29
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:12,480
into two categories, these
are procedural controls,

30
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,960
and legal or regulatory controls.

31
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,140
Procedural controls are those things

32
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:20,090
that your organization
chooses to do on its own.

33
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:22,530
Legal and regulatory
controls, on the other hand,

34
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:25,980
are ones that you have to do
because the law says you must.

35
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:28,740
For example, if you work
in the healthcare field,

36
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:30,500
you're going to have to follow HIPAA,

37
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,840
which is a regulation
and law that talks about

38
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:35,320
how you must secure the patients' data.

39
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,580
If you work in the
financial services industry,

40
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:40,270
you're going to be subject
to the Sarbanes-Oxley law,

41
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:43,320
which is a law here inside the
United States that discusses

42
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:47,230
how information must be
protected in that realm.

43
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:49,250
Now, we're going to go
into much more detail

44
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:52,110
into each of these areas
later on in the course.

45
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:54,380
For now, one thing I want to point out is

46
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:57,470
that user training, while it's
an administrative control,

47
00:01:57,470 --> 00:02:00,210
is one of the most
cost-effective security controls

48
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:02,930
that you can utilize, because
at the end of the day,

49
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:05,630
no matter how many technical
controls you put in place,

50
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:07,140
you can have great firewalls,

51
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:09,527
an intrusion detection
systems, and encryption,

52
00:02:09,527 --> 00:02:11,270
and all of these other things,

53
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:13,540
but if your user is going
to bypass all of those

54
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:15,980
by clicking on a link inside of an email

55
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:18,480
or sticking a thumb
drive into the computer,

56
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,440
it's going to go right through
all of your technical controls.

57
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,790
And so, you want to make sure
that you're using a good blend

58
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:26,350
of all three control types, physical,

59
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:28,457
technical, and administrative.
