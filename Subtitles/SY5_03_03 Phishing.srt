1
00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:03,610
- In this lesson I'm going
to show you how easy it is

2
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:05,670
to conduct your own phishing campaign

3
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:07,880
so you can test your
users and see if they know

4
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:11,170
the correct practices and
how to avoid a phishing scam.

5
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:13,340
Now in this campaign
what we're going to do

6
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:14,830
is create our own email,

7
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:17,160
we're going to send it out to our users

8
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:17,993
inside our organization,

9
00:00:17,993 --> 00:00:19,660
see if they click on any of those links,

10
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:22,890
and if they do we're going to
provide them remedial training.

11
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:25,490
To do all of this it's
not complicated at all.

12
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:27,610
In fact, you can use a free program

13
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:30,250
that's provided by Trend
Micro to do this for you.

14
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:32,690
This program is called Phish Insights.

15
00:00:32,690 --> 00:00:35,430
To access Phish Insight
you simply need to go to

16
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:38,370
phishinsite.trendmicro.com.

17
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:39,700
If you've never used it before

18
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:41,820
you'll have to sign up
and create an account.

19
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:44,680
Again, this is a wonderful free tool.

20
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:46,730
Next you will log into your account.

21
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:49,350
So if we want to create
a campaign for ourself

22
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:51,861
we're just going to click
on Create a Campaign.

23
00:00:51,861 --> 00:00:54,200
Now I'm going to make a
very small campaign here

24
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,510
of just one target.

25
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:56,970
So I'm just going to key in the recipient

26
00:00:56,970 --> 00:00:59,320
of who I want to send this message to.

27
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:02,280
And the person I'm going
to send it to is Jason.

28
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,250
So I'm just going to
call my list name Jason.

29
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:06,423
And I'm going to put Jason,
Dion, Jason@diantraining.com,

30
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:12,223
and his title which is instructor.

31
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:14,280
And that should be fine.

32
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,660
And then we'll hit continue.

33
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:17,520
And you'll see that I now
have First Name Jason,

34
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,570
Last Name Dion, Department is Instructor,

35
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:20,830
and his Email Address.

36
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:22,240
Go ahead and hit Done.

37
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:25,730
Next, I'll go down to step 2
which is selecting a template.

38
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:27,350
What I'm going to do is
I'm going to select one

39
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:29,460
that looks like a LinkedIn
connection request

40
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:31,200
'cause we get those all day long.

41
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,510
And most of those don't think
twice about clicking on them.

42
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:36,240
So if I just click on that here's the

43
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,370
email they're going to get.

44
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:40,780
It's going to say Jason, please
add me to your LinkedIn network

45
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:43,170
and all these places
would add in Jason Dion.

46
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:46,280
Hi Jason Dion, I'd like to
join your LinkedIn network.

47
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:48,120
And there's the Accept
or the View profile,

48
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:50,470
the update, subscribe, all
that kind of good stuff.

49
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:53,320
And this looks like a
very realistic email,

50
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,600
and it's already done for us.

51
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,570
If we wanted to we could customize it

52
00:01:56,570 --> 00:01:58,240
to make it look less like LinkedIn

53
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,750
or more like something else.

54
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:01,697
But for now we're going
to use this default.

55
00:02:01,697 --> 00:02:04,690
Next, we're going to
go through and specify

56
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:06,670
what the email address
is going to come from.

57
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:10,510
In my case it's going to come
from invitations@linkein.com.

58
00:02:10,510 --> 00:02:13,160
Notice the email is not
actually spelled out linkedin.

59
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,440
They're missing a d.

60
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,680
This is something that
our user should see,

61
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:19,660
and hopefully flag it as a phishing scam

62
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:21,050
as opposed to a real one.

63
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:23,660
And notice that invitations
is also spelled wrong.

64
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:26,870
But if you wanted to make
this look very, very realistic

65
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:29,370
you could actually put the exact correct

66
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:33,780
invitations@linkedin,com
and spell it all correctly.

67
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:36,610
Next you can set up a
schedule and run your campaign

68
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:39,390
over several weeks or
over one week or two weeks

69
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:40,420
or even a month.

70
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:42,580
And this is good if you
have a larger organization

71
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:44,060
where you're doing this

72
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:45,290
with hundreds or thousands of employees.

73
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:47,320
You want to see if they learn over time.

74
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:49,660
And so by doing that you
can set up a schedule.

75
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:52,570
You can also, then, decide what happens

76
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:54,370
if they click on one of the links.

77
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:56,620
So I can have when the campaign ends

78
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:57,990
they will get training and be told,

79
00:02:57,990 --> 00:02:59,580
yes, you clicked on a link
and you shouldn't have

80
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:00,790
or no you didn't.

81
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:02,010
Or you can do it immediately

82
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:03,750
when they click on a
link and they're phished.

83
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,850
They might get something
that looks like this.

84
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:07,310
This is a webpage that would come up

85
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:09,360
and say, hey, you've been phished.

86
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,840
You need some remedial training.

87
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,870
Click here and you'll get the training.

88
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:14,120
Something of that nature.

89
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:16,540
So that's the way you can do that.

90
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:19,950
And if we go back up
here to our invitation,

91
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:22,420
setting our schedule, or you
can do it without notice.

92
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:24,460
So I'm going to leave
it with when phished.

93
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:26,430
And then you can send
yourself a text message

94
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:28,323
or confirm to start the campaign.

95
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:33,930
So now you'll see that
that campaign is upcoming,

96
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:37,000
and it will start in
about an hour from now.

97
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,840
Once that happens we'll be
able to see who gets fooled,

98
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,660
analyze those results, and
give those people training.

99
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:45,480
So let's look at an
example phishing email.

100
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:48,900
I just sent one out that showed
it was coming from LinkedIn.

101
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:51,310
Now this is what the user is going to see.

102
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:54,570
From all looks it looks
like a legitimate email.

103
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:55,960
If I look at the subject line,

104
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:59,130
it says Jason, please add
me to your LinkedIn network.

105
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:02,060
If I look at who it came from,
it came form invitations.

106
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:04,510
And if I look at the message
it's got the LinkedIn logo,

107
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:07,240
it's got things that look
just like a LinkedIn message.

108
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,520
But it's not.

109
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,880
If I click on any of these links

110
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,630
it's not going to take me to LinkedIn.

111
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:14,000
Instead, it's going to take
me to a phishing website.

112
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,950
And as you see as I hover over it

113
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:17,280
notice what the link is.

114
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,660
It's not LinkedIn.com.

115
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:20,800
It's websitefun.club.

116
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,230
Then I go over here to the profile one.

117
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:24,920
Same thing, it brings me to
another area of that website.

118
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,900
Changing the frequency, same thing.

119
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:29,670
This is a classic phishing scam,

120
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:30,910
where it looks like one thing,

121
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:33,110
but when you click on
it it goes to another.

122
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:35,150
Notice this email is well crafted.

123
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:37,680
It's crafted to look
exactly like LinkedIn.

124
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,100
And it will trick a lot of your users.

125
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:42,580
So one of the things we want to
do with our phishing campaigns

126
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:45,910
is to train our users that
clicking links is bad.

127
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:49,810
Instead, if I got this as
a user what should I do?

128
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:51,460
I should open up a new web browser.

129
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:54,400
And I should go to
LinkedIn.com, the site I know.

130
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,740
And from there I can accept
or reject that friend request.

131
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:59,720
But just getting an email,
you don't want to click

132
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,850
on those links because that is an easy way

133
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:03,710
to get yourself into trouble because

134
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:05,230
it can download malware

135
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:07,500
or it might just collect
information from you.

136
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,420
Like you click on it says
we need your user name

137
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:11,130
and password to log into LinkedIn.

138
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:12,370
And they have a website sitting there

139
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:14,140
that looks just like LinkedIn.

140
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:15,470
And when you give them that information

141
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:17,200
they now have your credentials,

142
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:20,122
and they can take advantage
of that for other attacks.

143
00:05:20,122 --> 00:05:22,197
(light music)
