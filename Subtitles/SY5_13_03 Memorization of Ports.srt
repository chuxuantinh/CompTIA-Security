1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:02,530
- This is probably one of
the most important videos

2
00:00:02,530 --> 00:00:04,160
we're going to cover in the course.

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:05,670
Did I get your attention yet?

4
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:07,700
Here's the video that
I want you to bookmark,

5
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:09,740
take notes and even create flashcards

6
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:11,350
based on what you see.

7
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:13,150
This is so important that I just spent

8
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:15,290
the first 30 seconds
of this video stressing

9
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:16,560
how important it is.

10
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:17,393
What is it?

11
00:00:17,393 --> 00:00:18,900
It's memorizing port numbers

12
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:20,501
and its associated protocols.

13
00:00:20,501 --> 00:00:22,370
As I just said in the last lesson,

14
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:26,630
there are 65,536 ports
available for your computer

15
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:27,950
and your network to use.

16
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:31,310
Yes, 65,536.

17
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:33,810
And because ports can go
anywhere from port zero

18
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:36,470
all the way up to 65,535,

19
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:38,170
because computers start counting at zero,

20
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:39,770
that's how we get that number.

21
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:40,840
Now, luckily for you,

22
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:41,790
you don't have to memorize

23
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:44,140
all these 65 thousand plus ports.

24
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:46,760
But there are 35 ports that you simply

25
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:48,520
have to memorize for the exam.

26
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:50,010
To cover them I'm going to provide you

27
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:51,120
with the port number,

28
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,520
the protocol it's used for

29
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,820
and whether it relies on TCP or UDP

30
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:56,680
for its transport layer protocol.

31
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:58,050
All right, with that said,

32
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:00,810
let's get started with
the memorization of ports.

33
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:04,040
The first one is FTP or
the File Transfer Protocol.

34
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:06,140
It's used to transfer
files from host to host

35
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:09,750
and operates over port 21 using TCP.

36
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:12,240
Next we have SSH or Secure Shell.

37
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,380
It's used to remotely
administer network devices

38
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:18,680
and systems over port 22
using either TCP or UDP.

39
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:22,480
Also over port 22 we have
secure copy called SCP

40
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:25,440
and it's used to securely
copy files over a network.

41
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:29,230
Also on port 22 we have
SFTP or secure FTP.

42
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:31,210
It's also going to be
operated over port 22

43
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:32,980
and is a secure method of uploading

44
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:35,860
and downloading your files over a network.

45
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:37,540
Next we have Telnet which is used

46
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:39,670
to remotely administer network devices,

47
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:41,970
but it doesn't provide any security.

48
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:43,770
In fact, Telnet will send everything

49
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,500
over the network in an unencrypted,

50
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,920
clear text format making it very dangerous

51
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,010
for you to use.

52
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:50,990
For this reason you should disable Telnet

53
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:52,010
in your network.

54
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:54,160
For the exam remember
that Telnet is operated

55
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:57,988
over port 23 and uses both TCP and UDP.

56
00:01:57,988 --> 00:01:59,110
The next one we have is

57
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:01,860
Simple Mail Transfer Protocol or SMTP.

58
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:04,330
And it's used to send
email over the Internet.

59
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:08,360
It operates over port 25
using a TCP connection.

60
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,780
Domain Name Service or DNS is our next one

61
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:13,110
and it's used to resolve host names to IPs

62
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:14,760
and IPs to host names.

63
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,950
When you look at something
like diontraining.com

64
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:21,570
and convert it to 184.168.131.241,

65
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:23,309
this is DNS operating at work.

66
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:26,240
DNS is going to operate over port 53

67
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:29,450
and uses both TCP and UDP connections.

68
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:32,330
Our next one is TFTP or Trivial FTP

69
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:33,950
and it's used as a simplified version

70
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:36,430
of FTP to put a file on a remote host

71
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:38,600
or get a file from a remote host.

72
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:41,887
It operates over port 69
using a UDP connection.

73
00:02:41,887 --> 00:02:43,640
It isn't one of the most secure types

74
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,610
of file transfer but it is lightweight,

75
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:46,770
so often it's used to boot

76
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:49,000
a network operating system off of a server

77
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,660
and onto a thin-client.

78
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:53,700
HTTP or Hyper Text Transfer Protocol

79
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,050
is widely used.

80
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:57,750
It's used to transmit
webpage data for a client

81
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:59,310
over an unencrypted connection

82
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:01,130
whenever you're browsing the Internet.

83
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:04,700
HTTP uses port 80 and transmits using TCP.

84
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:06,770
Our next one is Kerberos.

85
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:08,760
Kerberos is used for
network authentication

86
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:11,570
using a system of tickets
within a Windows domain.

87
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:14,130
It operates using both TCP and UDP

88
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:15,823
and operates on port 88.

89
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:20,290
Next we have POP3 or the
Post Office Protocol v3

90
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:22,860
and it's used to receive
mail from a mail server.

91
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:25,379
It operates over TCP port 110.

92
00:03:25,379 --> 00:03:28,480
This port is for the
unencrypted POP3 services.

93
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,260
We'll talk about the
encrypted version later on.

94
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:33,260
Our next one is NNTP

95
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:35,650
which is the Network
News Transfer Protocol.

96
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:38,700
It's used to transport
Usenet articles to a client.

97
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:42,590
It operates using TCP over port 119.

98
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:44,150
Next we have RPC,

99
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:46,290
the Remote Procedure Call and it's used

100
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:48,630
to locate DCOM ports to request a service

101
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:50,470
from a program on another computer

102
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:51,660
over the network.

103
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:53,780
This is commonly used in
Windows based networks

104
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:57,843
and operates using both
TCP and UDP over port 135.

105
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,610
Next we have NetBIOS and it's used

106
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:02,000
to conduct name querying,

107
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,670
sending of data and other functions

108
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:05,420
over a NetBIOS connection.

109
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:07,210
This operates over three ports,

110
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:10,110
137, 138 and 139

111
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:12,263
using both TCP and UDP.

112
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,610
IMAP or the Internet
Message Access Protocol

113
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:17,640
is used to receive
email from a mail server

114
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:20,210
with more features than
your POP3 servers do.

115
00:04:20,210 --> 00:04:22,370
It's going to operate over port 143

116
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:24,226
using TCP when unencrypted.

117
00:04:24,226 --> 00:04:25,160
Now, we'll talk

118
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,386
about the encrypted version later on.

119
00:04:27,386 --> 00:04:30,830
SNMP is the Simple Network
Management Protocol.

120
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:32,930
It's used to remotely
monitor network devices

121
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:36,730
using a UDP connection over port 161.

122
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:38,170
Now we go to 162,

123
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:40,930
this is the port reserved for SNMPTRAP.

124
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:43,310
This is used to send
Trap and InformRequests

125
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:45,360
to the SNMP Manager on a network

126
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,240
using both TCP and UDP connections.

127
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,710
Next we have LDAP or the

128
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:51,840
Lightweight Directory Access Protocol.

129
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,770
It's used to maintain directories of users

130
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:55,150
and other objects.

131
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:56,610
If you're using Active Directory

132
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:58,820
inside a Windows environment this relies

133
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:00,440
on LDAP to function.

134
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:03,350
LDAP will use port 389 over both TCP

135
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:04,870
and UDP connections.

136
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:07,800
We'll talk about its
encrypted variate later on.

137
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,880
Next we have HTTPS

138
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:12,220
or the Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure

139
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:13,210
which is what you're using

140
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:14,830
to watch this course right now.

141
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:16,870
It's used to transmit
web pages to a client

142
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:19,371
over an SSL or TLS encrypted connection.

143
00:05:19,371 --> 00:05:22,140
Essentially, this is
the same thing as HTTP

144
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:24,050
over port 80 except it's going to use

145
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:26,290
an encrypted tunnel to
secure that information

146
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:27,990
and make sure nobody can see it.

147
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:30,351
This is going to ensure
confidentiality for us.

148
00:05:30,351 --> 00:05:34,432
HTTPS uses port 443 and a TCP connection.

149
00:05:34,432 --> 00:05:37,920
Next we have the Server
Message Block or SMB

150
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,320
and it's used to provide
shared access to files

151
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,400
and other resources over a network.

152
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,550
It's going to operate on port 445

153
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:46,680
using a TCP connection.

154
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,740
Earlier we talked about SMTP,

155
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:50,800
the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol.

156
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,640
But now we're going to talk

157
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,050
about the secure version of it,

158
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:56,870
the Simple Mail Transfer
Protocol over SSL or TLS.

159
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:58,280
This is going to be used to send email

160
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,800
over the Internet inside
of an encrypted tunnel

161
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,950
to make sure you maintain confidentiality.

162
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:04,620
This is going to use one of two ports,

163
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:08,100
either 465 or 587 and it's going to use it

164
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,840
over a TCP connection.

165
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,400
Just like we had HTTP and HTTPS,

166
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:16,595
this is the same thing
with SMTP and SMTP Secure.

167
00:06:16,595 --> 00:06:18,840
Now, Syslog is going to be used

168
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,780
to conduct computer message logging,

169
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:23,210
especially for routers and firewall logs.

170
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:26,263
It operates over port 514 using UDP.

171
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:31,380
LDAP over SSL or TLS
operates over port 636

172
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:33,540
using either TCP or UDP.

173
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:35,530
Again, LDAP is used to
maintain directories

174
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:38,330
of users and other objects
over an encrypted SSL

175
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:41,030
or TLS connection and it's
simply the secure version

176
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:43,560
of LDAP and Active Directory.

177
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,974
Next we have iSCSI.

178
00:06:44,974 --> 00:06:46,130
iSCSI is used

179
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:48,820
for linking data storage
facilities over IP.

180
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:51,140
This is commonly used in
storage area networks.

181
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:54,300
iSCSI is going to operate on port 860

182
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:56,480
and it's using TCP.

183
00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:00,470
Next we have File Transfer
Protocol Secure or FTPS.

184
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:02,840
This is used to transfer
files from host to host

185
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,440
over an encrypted connection.

186
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:07,260
By default FTP doesn't
provide any encryption

187
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,810
and it sends everything in the clear.

188
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:12,549
But with FTPS going over port 989 and 990,

189
00:07:12,549 --> 00:07:14,750
this is going to give us a TCP connection

190
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:16,850
that is secured with an encryption tunnel

191
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:18,440
and this is going to
make it much more secure

192
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,200
for us to send our files.

193
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,440
Our next secure variant is for IMAP.

194
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,273
If you remember,

195
00:07:23,273 --> 00:07:25,420
IMAP is the Internet
Message Access Protocol

196
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:27,940
and it's used to receive
email from a mail server.

197
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:29,980
But this time we're going
to do it over an SSL

198
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:31,860
or TLS encrypted connection.

199
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:36,000
When we do that we're going
to use port 993 using TCP.

200
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,510
Next we have the secure version of POP3

201
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:39,950
which again, is used to receive email

202
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:42,000
from a mail server using an SSL

203
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,900
or TLS encrypted connection.

204
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:45,990
This is going to provide
us better confidentiality

205
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:47,770
by ensuring everything is encrypted.

206
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:51,163
It's going to operate
over port 995 over TCP.

207
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:54,880
Next I have port 1433 which is used

208
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,850
by the Microsoft SQL server

209
00:07:56,850 --> 00:07:59,930
to receive SQL database
queries from its clients.

210
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:02,550
This is going to use a TCP connection.

211
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:03,900
Then we have RADIUS

212
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,880
which is the Remote Authentication Dial-In

213
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:08,070
User Service and it's
used for authentication

214
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:10,910
and authorization over port 1645

215
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:13,740
and accounting over port 1646.

216
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:15,750
Now, these two ports are an alternative

217
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:19,200
to its standard ports of 1812 and 1813.

218
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,043
RADIUS operates using UDP.

219
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:23,820
Next we're going to talk about L2TP

220
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:26,090
which is our first VPN related protocol.

221
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:30,394
L2TP operates over port 1701 using UDP.

222
00:08:30,394 --> 00:08:33,170
L2TP stands for the Layer
2 Tunneling Protocol

223
00:08:33,170 --> 00:08:35,930
and is used as an underlying VPN protocol

224
00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:37,850
but has no inherent security.

225
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:40,730
Because of this if you use L2TP you need

226
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:41,810
to make sure that you're pairing it

227
00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:44,740
with IPsec to ensure
you have good security.

228
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:46,570
Another protocol when we deal with VPNs

229
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:48,600
is called the PPTP,

230
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,690
the Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol.

231
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:52,530
It's another underlying VPN protocol

232
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:53,440
but this one,

233
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,210
unlike L2TP, has built-in security.

234
00:08:56,210 --> 00:08:59,700
PPTP operates over port 1723

235
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:02,760
using both TCP and UDP connections.

236
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,790
Now, a few slides ago
we talked about RADIUS

237
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:08,190
and we said that it
used ports 1645 and 1646

238
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:09,660
as its alternate ports.

239
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:12,490
Well, its defaults are 1812 and 1813

240
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:13,910
as you can see now.

241
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:15,340
This is just a reminder that RADIUS

242
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:17,380
is going to use these ports over UDP,

243
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:19,155
just like we talked about before.

244
00:09:19,155 --> 00:09:22,450
FCIP or the Fibre Channel IP is used

245
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:24,230
to encapsulate Fibre Channel frames

246
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,510
within TCP/IP packets.

247
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:27,440
This is usually used

248
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,360
for storage area networks as well.

249
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,630
Now, FCIP operates over port 3225

250
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:35,081
over both TCP and UDP.

251
00:09:35,081 --> 00:09:37,600
Earlier in this lesson
we talked about iSCSI.

252
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,870
But we're going to return to it now

253
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:40,260
to cover the Target side of it.

254
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:42,840
iSCSI Target is a listening port

255
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:45,340
for iSCSI targeted devices
when they're linking

256
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:47,640
data storage facilities over IP.

257
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:52,070
It's going to operate
on port 3260 over TCP.

258
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:53,410
Next we have RDP,

259
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:55,560
the Remote Desktop Protocol which is used

260
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:58,080
to remotely view and control
other Windows systems

261
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,260
via a graphical User Interface.

262
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:04,421
It does this over port 3389
using both TCP and UDP.

263
00:10:04,421 --> 00:10:06,010
Now, be careful with this one

264
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:08,830
because it's 3389 for RDP

265
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:11,670
but 389 for LDAP and a
lot of times students

266
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:13,500
will get those two confused.

267
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,870
Next we have Diameter
which is a more advanced

268
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:17,720
AAA protocol than RADIUS

269
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,900
and it serves as a replacement for RADIUS.

270
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:22,590
It also operates over port 3868

271
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:25,847
and it uses TCP as its
connection mechanism.

272
00:10:25,847 --> 00:10:29,120
Next we have a Syslog over TLS connection

273
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:29,953
which is going to be used

274
00:10:29,953 --> 00:10:31,640
to conduct computer message logging,

275
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,470
especially for routers and firewalls

276
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:35,702
over a TLS encrypted connection.

277
00:10:35,702 --> 00:10:40,702
Syslog over TLS operates
on port 6514 using TCP.

278
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:43,730
Now, I know that was a lot of information

279
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:45,600
in a very short amount of time.

280
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,940
After watching this video once

281
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:49,150
I know you don't have all
those ports memorized.

282
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:51,470
I recommend making a
list and testing yourself

283
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:53,600
over and over again on these ports.

284
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,870
This is critical information

285
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:56,890
to answer a lot of questions on the exam,

286
00:10:56,890 --> 00:10:58,546
either directly or indirectly.

287
00:10:58,546 --> 00:11:00,660
Remember, you can rewatch this video

288
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,091
as many times as you like.

289
00:11:02,091 --> 00:11:04,270
And our study notes we
gave you at the beginning

290
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:06,067
of this course have all the information

291
00:11:06,067 --> 00:11:08,240
from these slides included in it.

292
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,480
Now, with that being said,

293
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:12,010
I do recommend you make
flashcards with the protocol

294
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:14,080
on one side and the
ports and the connection

295
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:14,940
on the other side,

296
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:16,410
and use that to test yourself

297
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:18,190
and aid in your memorization.

298
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:20,960
For example, if you have
one side that has HTTP,

299
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:23,530
the other side should have port 80, TCP.

300
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:25,620
Take time to learn these
ports and protocols

301
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:26,453
for the exam.

302
00:11:26,453 --> 00:11:27,286
I promise you,

303
00:11:27,286 --> 00:11:29,050
your time is spent very well here

304
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:31,100
and you're going to be
rewarded on test day.
