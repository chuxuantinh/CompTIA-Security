1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:02,310
- Now that we've dug into the concept

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:03,750
of risk a little bit more,

3
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:04,870
I think it's appropriate for us

4
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:07,010
to cover the concept of security controls

5
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:08,580
because that's exactly
what we're going to use

6
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:10,970
when we try to mitigate a particular risk.

7
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:13,200
Now, security controls
are first broken down

8
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,150
into three types, physical,
technical and administrative.

9
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:18,070
As you might guess,

10
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:19,930
physical controls are security measures

11
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:21,760
that are designed to deter or prevent

12
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,980
unauthorized access to
sensitive information

13
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:25,440
or the systems that contain it,

14
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,650
by preventing physical access.

15
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:29,440
So when we discussed physical security

16
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:30,600
earlier in this course,

17
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,880
we were focused on a
lot of physical controls

18
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,620
like fences and door locks

19
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:36,940
and alarm systems and security guards,

20
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:38,370
all of these things are focused

21
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:41,490
on protecting the physical
computers, servers and networks

22
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:44,740
from being accessed by people
outside our organization.

23
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:46,360
Our second type of security control

24
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:48,210
is called the technical control.

25
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:50,740
Technical controls are
safeguards and countermeasures.

26
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:54,140
They're used to avoid, detect,
counteract, and minimize

27
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:57,160
our security risks to our
systems and information.

28
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:00,150
So we talk about using passwords
and access controllers,

29
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:02,270
and encryption for our hard drives

30
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:04,000
and multi-factor authentication,

31
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,630
we're really talking about
technical controls here.

32
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:08,190
The third type of security control

33
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:10,320
is called an administrative control.

34
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,950
Administrative controls are focused

35
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:13,720
on changing the behavior of people

36
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:16,250
instead of removing the
actual risk involved.

37
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:18,180
So if I create a policy or procedure,

38
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:20,710
that states that every employee
has to lock their computer

39
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:22,540
whenever they're going to
be away from their desk,

40
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:24,340
this is an administrative control.

41
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:26,510
There's no technical
control being used here.

42
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:29,110
If you get up and walk away
and return within two minutes,

43
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:30,640
and you didn't lock your workstation,

44
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,490
there's no technical control
that's going to lock it for you.

45
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:36,630
I just made up a policy and
it's purely administrative.

46
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:38,470
Now, other examples of this include things

47
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:41,630
like mandatory vacations,
user education and training,

48
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:43,310
creating disaster recovery plans,

49
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:45,110
and implementing job rotation,

50
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:48,110
all of these are examples
of administrative controls.

51
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:50,670
Now, the National Institute
of Standards and Technology

52
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:53,600
or NIST, actually has
three other categories

53
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,940
that we organize Security
Controls in as well.

54
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:57,460
These are management controls,

55
00:01:57,460 --> 00:02:00,280
operational controls
and technical controls.

56
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:02,230
Management controls are security controls

57
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:03,690
that are focused on decision-making

58
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:05,530
and the management of risk.

59
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:06,680
This usually includes things

60
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:09,760
like policies, procedures,
legal compliance,

61
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:12,070
software development
methodologies that you choose,

62
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:14,400
setting up a good vulnerability
management program,

63
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,090
and other things like that.

64
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:18,930
Management controls are all
about how your system security

65
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:21,340
is going to be managed and overseen.

66
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:23,170
Now, operational controls are focused

67
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:25,050
on things that are done by people.

68
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:27,060
With operational controls
I'm trying to increase

69
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:29,600
the security of the system,
by controlling the actions

70
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,800
of the individuals and
the groups who use it.

71
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,680
This includes user training,
configuration management,

72
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,510
testing our disaster recovery plans,

73
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:38,430
and conducting incident handling.

74
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:40,570
These controls are performed
by technical people

75
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:42,730
in order to carry out
the overall direction

76
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:45,100
that was provided by management controls.

77
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:48,280
The third category NIST uses,
is called technical controls.

78
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,990
These are logical controls that are put

79
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:52,070
into a system to help secure it.

80
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:53,620
This is things like triple A,

81
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:56,300
the authentication,
authorization and accounting,

82
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:59,420
access control, encryption
technology, passwords,

83
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:01,470
and configuring your security devices.

84
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:03,990
Anything that is technical
and performed by the computer

85
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:06,510
can really be put into this category.

86
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:08,350
So, now that we've covered
two different groups

87
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:09,820
of three categories each,

88
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:13,210
I bet you think we're done but
unfortunately, not quite yet.

89
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:15,270
We have yet another group of three,

90
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:17,500
that can be used to
describe security controls.

91
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:20,790
They are preventive,
detective, and corrective.

92
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:22,780
Preventative controls
are security controls

93
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:25,080
that are installed
before an event happens,

94
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,430
and they're designed to prevent
something from occurring.

95
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:29,010
For example, you might install

96
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:31,960
a technical control like a
RAID in your file server,

97
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,450
to ensure that your data
always has redundancy available

98
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:36,540
and prevent data loss from occurring.

99
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:38,310
Maybe you're worried about a power outage,

100
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:40,230
so you install battery backup or an UPS,

101
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:42,890
in order to prevent a brownout
or a blackout from happening

102
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:45,070
and causing your
workstation to lose power.

103
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:47,890
These are considered
preventative controls.

104
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:50,860
The second type of control is
called a detective control.

105
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:52,680
Detective controls are
used during an event

106
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:55,500
to find out whether or not
something bad may have happened.

107
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,330
If you have a closed-circuit TV system,

108
00:03:57,330 --> 00:03:58,960
being monitored by a security guard,

109
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:01,070
this is a type of detective control.

110
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:03,720
Intrusion detection systems,
audit logs and alarms

111
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:06,370
are all different types of
detective controls as well,

112
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:08,100
when they have logging enabled.

113
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:10,440
Now, these aren't going to
stop a bad thing from happening

114
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,230
but they are going to
allow you to at least know

115
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:14,330
that it happened and follow up on it.

116
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:17,200
The third type of control is
called a corrective control.

117
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,800
Corrective controls are
used after an event occurs.

118
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,900
So, let's say somebody
hacks into your server

119
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:23,490
and they erase your hard drive,

120
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:25,070
well if this happens you're going to hope

121
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:26,890
you have a good backup copy somewhere.

122
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:28,730
If you've been doing good tape backups,

123
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:30,590
this is called a corrective control

124
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:32,900
because it's going to allow you
to recover from this data loss

125
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:35,430
and by fixing something after it happens,

126
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:37,500
it becomes a corrective control.

127
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:38,840
Other examples of this are found

128
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:41,700
as part of incident response
or disaster recovery,

129
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:43,720
or restoring technologies for data loss,

130
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,880
or replacing devices
that've been malfunctioned,

131
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:48,280
or switching your operations
to an alternate location,

132
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,670
to continue your business functions

133
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:51,550
in case there's a disaster and you need

134
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:53,600
a continuity of operations.

135
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,290
So you may be wondering,
can something be in one

136
00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:57,440
or more categories?

137
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,810
Well, absolutely.

138
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:00,900
I've mentioned some of
them as we've gone through.

139
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:03,630
Consider the example of a
closed-circuit TV system,

140
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:06,520
if I have it installed it can
serve as a detective control

141
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,470
because I can see if
something's happening,

142
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:11,180
but it's also categorized
as a physical control

143
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:13,030
because it protects our physical devices

144
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:15,690
by allowing us to see people
as they approach the devices.

145
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,560
Similarly, if I have a password policy

146
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,940
created for my organization,

147
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:20,740
this isn't just a management control

148
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:23,290
but it's also an administrative
control because again,

149
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:25,610
policies fall into both those areas.

150
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:28,480
Now, I know we've covered a lot
of different controls so far

151
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,990
but I have just one more control to cover,

152
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:33,240
it's called a compensating control.

153
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,760
Now a compensating control is
used whenever you can't meet

154
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:38,260
the requirements for a normal control.

155
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:39,980
For example, let's say your organization

156
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:41,690
has a physical security policy

157
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:44,050
that states that every
door to a networking closet

158
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:47,440
or server room has to have a
retina scan enabled door lock,

159
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,490
to protect the devices in those rooms.

160
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:51,880
Well, maybe one of your
branch offices is located

161
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,710
in some far off country overseas,

162
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:56,110
and they have no retina
scan enabled door locks

163
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:57,730
being sold in that region.

164
00:05:57,730 --> 00:06:00,010
Well, instead of using
a retina scan door lock,

165
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:02,320
you decide to install a cipher door lock.

166
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:05,220
The cipher lock will be
considered a compensating control

167
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:07,800
until you can get a retina
scan enabled door lock

168
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,640
ordered, shipped and
installed at this location.

169
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:13,070
Now, keep in mind that if you
use a compensating control,

170
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:15,030
you are putting in place a different thing

171
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:16,460
than the original requirement,

172
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:18,430
but you're still attempting
to get the same level

173
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:20,800
or close to the same level of security.

174
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,500
Any residual risk that is not covered

175
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,630
by the compensating control is considered

176
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:26,460
accepted risk by the organization

177
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:28,830
because this security
control doesn't fully cover

178
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:31,760
the same requirements as the
original control might've.

179
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:34,160
For the exam, I want you to
make sure you're prepared

180
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,030
to categorize things into these
different types of controls,

181
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:38,920
based on the ten types
of security controls

182
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,490
we covered in this lesson.

183
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:42,100
Keep in mind, some things can go

184
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:44,490
into multiple categories and that's okay,

185
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:46,560
that's why I presented these
things in the three groups

186
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,676
of three, and then the
compensating control.
