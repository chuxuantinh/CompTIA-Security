1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:02,320
- DNS attacks.

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:04,330
There are four different DNS attacks

3
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:07,070
that you have to know for
the security plus exam.

4
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:09,840
There're DNS poisoning,
unauthorized zone transfers,

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,810
altered hosts files,
and domain name kiting.

6
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:15,420
Now, DNS poisoning occurs
when the name resolution

7
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:18,920
information is modified
in the DNS server's cache.

8
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:20,600
This modification of the data is done

9
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,930
to redirect client computers to fraudulent

10
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:25,040
or incorrect websites usually as part of

11
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:26,490
follow-on attacks.

12
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:28,320
The DNS system was designed without a lot

13
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,350
of security embedded into it originally.

14
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:32,790
This open architecture
assumed a level of trust

15
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:34,270
with all the other servers

16
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:36,340
which I already told you
is a pretty bad idea,

17
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:38,150
but that has been taken advantage of

18
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:40,000
by malicious attackers because

19
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,760
trusting is a bad idea.

20
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,900
Now, DNS poisoning usually occurs

21
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:46,150
on a company's internal DNS servers

22
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:49,370
instead of on public-facing DNS
servers around the internet.

23
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:51,510
With this type of attack,
the internal client

24
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:53,310
on the network has to make a request

25
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:55,610
to go to a website like diontraining.com

26
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:57,130
and whenever they make that request

27
00:00:57,130 --> 00:00:58,440
the client first checks with their

28
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,770
local network's primary DNS server

29
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:03,320
to see if it knows the
IP address for that URL.

30
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,900
If someone has gone there recently

31
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:06,450
that IP address is
already going to be stored

32
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:09,550
in the local cache but
if the cache was poisoned

33
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:11,240
that user's now going to be redirected

34
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:14,170
to a malicious website
instead of the desired one.

35
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:16,760
To counter act DNS poisoning, secure DNS

36
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:19,566
also know as DNSSEC, has been created.

37
00:01:19,566 --> 00:01:22,210
DNSSEC uses encrypted digital signatures

38
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:24,940
when passing DNS
information between servers

39
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:26,790
to help protect it from poisoning.

40
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:29,310
You can also prevent your DNS
servers from being poisoned

41
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:31,140
by insuring that you're
running the latest patches

42
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:34,130
and the latest updates to
make sure it's protected.

43
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:36,000
Our next type of DNS attack is called

44
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,210
an unauthorized zone transfer.

45
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:39,870
DNS servers are normally configured

46
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:42,400
to provide DNS data to a zone transfer

47
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,010
which replicates information
to other servers.

48
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:46,720
With an unauthorized transfer though

49
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,020
an attacker requests a copy of

50
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:49,430
that zone transfer information

51
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:51,400
and if they receive it
they now have a list

52
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,630
of all of your server
names and IP addresses

53
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:56,190
and this helps them
plan for future attacks.

54
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:58,050
Because of this, zone transfers should

55
00:01:58,050 --> 00:01:59,980
always be restricted between two

56
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:01,810
known and trusted servers only

57
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:04,570
and not let other people
ask for zone transfers.

58
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:06,730
The third type of DNS attack is focused

59
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:08,260
on the client itself.

60
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:09,700
Every computer and workstation

61
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:12,140
has a file on it called the host file.

62
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:14,170
The host file is a plain text file

63
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:17,100
and it contains IP addresses and names.

64
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:18,670
This is a reference that
the operating system

65
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:21,630
is going to check every time
a DNS lookup is requested

66
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:23,650
prior to going to a DNS server.

67
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:26,270
So if the host file has a
domain name being requested,

68
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:28,150
it's simply going to provide
the host file version

69
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:30,330
of that DNS information
instead of going out

70
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:32,300
to a DNS server requesting it.

71
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:34,550
So for example, one day my son was not

72
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:36,870
doing his school work and
it was really upsetting me.

73
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:38,000
Instead I kept going up there

74
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,880
and seeing he was watching YouTube.

75
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:42,740
So, I logged into his
computer and I added the URL

76
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:45,450
for YouTube into his host
list and I pointed that

77
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:47,830
to the IP address for
his school's website.

78
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:50,610
Now, anytime my son typed in youtube.com

79
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:52,550
instead of getting the
DNS lookup for YouTube

80
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:54,150
and getting redirected to their server

81
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:55,970
he instead got the one from the host file

82
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:57,400
that I maliciously put in there

83
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,980
and it served up the
home page for his school.

84
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,780
Now, every time he tried to watch a video

85
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:04,260
he was told hey you got
to go to school, right?

86
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:05,350
I think this is pretty funny

87
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:06,820
and you may think it's funny too

88
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:08,930
but he was not very
happy about this change

89
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:10,440
and he couldn't for the life of him

90
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,460
figure out why YouTube
wouldn't come up on his laptop.

91
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:16,240
Now, I may have been a
malicious attacker here, right?

92
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,920
But I own the system so it's okay.

93
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,130
But if I was really doing this on

94
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:21,200
somebody else's computer
I could have changed

95
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,970
that host file to redirect it to a server

96
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:25,880
that I controlled, create a
website to look like YouTube

97
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,860
and then tricked them into logging in

98
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:30,460
and providing their
username and password to me.

99
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,570
To prevent your host file
from being manipulated

100
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:34,710
it should always be set to read only.

101
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:37,130
On your Windows machine,
your host file's located

102
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:42,130
in the systemroot\system32\drivers\etc
directory.

103
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:45,090
This brings up the concept of pharming,

104
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:47,280
which is essentially what
I was doing to my son.

105
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,220
Pharming occurs when an attacker redirects

106
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:51,520
one website's traffic to another website

107
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,250
that is bogus or malicious.

108
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:55,140
This is done by poisoning the DNS

109
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:57,580
or by modifying the host file on a system.

110
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:59,520
Anyway you do it, if
you're trying to redirect

111
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,940
somebody to another website

112
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:02,810
that's usually considered pharming.

113
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:06,030
Now our final attack is
called domain name kiting.

114
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:08,440
This attack exploits the
way that the registration

115
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,350
process works for a domain name.

116
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:12,680
Normally, you're given
a five-day grace period

117
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,020
when you're adding a domain name,

118
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:16,090
but if you delete it
before that five days is up

119
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:18,760
and you re-add it again,
the five days restarts.

120
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:21,200
So this lets an attacker
gobble up domain names

121
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,730
without ever having to pay for them.

122
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:24,940
And they can just keep
them in this limbo state.

123
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:27,410
This is more of an abuse of
the system than a real attack

124
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:29,080
but it does prevent a legitimate buyer

125
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,580
from obtaining that domain name

126
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:33,413
and so we do consider it an
attack in the security plus.
