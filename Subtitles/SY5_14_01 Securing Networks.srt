00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:01,620
- In this section of the course,

2
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:03,760
we're going to talk
about securing your wired

3
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:05,370
and wireless networks.

4
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:07,300
We're going to start out
with wired network devices,

5
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:09,040
things like switches and routers,

6
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:10,700
and then we'll move into the cabling

7
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:12,950
that helps put all
these networks together.

8
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:14,260
After that, we're going to start talking

9
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:15,470
about wireless networks

10
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:17,070
and how we can better secure them

11
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:18,440
and all the different types of attacks

12
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:20,500
that exist for wireless networks.

13
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:22,880
We'll even go through a
demonstration in this section

14
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,530
where I'm going to show you how easy it is

15
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:26,030
to break wireless encryption

16
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:26,920
and we'll be able to do that

17
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:28,610
in about just two or three minutes.

18
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:30,240
So it's really important to understand

19
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,100
how to secure your networks properly

20
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:34,410
so attackers can't do this to you.

21
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:36,710
Now finally, we're going
to round out this section

22
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:39,100
by covering other types
of wireless technology

23
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:40,420
in addition to wifi,

24
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:43,310
things like RFID,
near-field communications,

25
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:45,460
bluetooth, satellite communication,

26
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:47,720
GPS, cellular, and others.

27
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:49,806
So let's get started.

28
00:00:49,806 --> 00:00:51,994
