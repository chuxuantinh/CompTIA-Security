1
00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:02,650
- Fire suppression.

2
00:00:02,650 --> 00:00:05,357
Now fire suppression is
the process of controlling

3
00:00:05,357 --> 00:00:07,890
and/or extinguishing fires to protect

4
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:10,780
your organization's
employees, data, equipment,

5
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:11,970
and buildings.

6
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:13,953
You have to choose the right
type of fire suppression

7
00:00:13,953 --> 00:00:15,920
and this is probably going
to be one of the most

8
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:18,550
important facility decisions
that your organization

9
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:21,090
is going to make to ensure
that it's long-term safety

10
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:24,780
of its employees and its
networks remains unchallenged.

11
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:26,930
Now there are three
types of fire suppression

12
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:29,810
that we have to discuss
for the Security Plus exam.

13
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:31,570
There's handheld fire extinguishers,

14
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:34,740
sprinkler systems, and special
hazard protection systems

15
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:37,230
that we use especially
in our server rooms.

16
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:39,292
Now let's discuss handheld
extinguishers first

17
00:00:39,292 --> 00:00:41,650
because they're not created equally.

18
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:43,710
Each one is a little bit different.

19
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,998
In fact, before you choose
the proper extinguisher

20
00:00:45,998 --> 00:00:48,330
you need to identify what class of fire

21
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:49,880
you're trying to put out.

22
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:52,650
Fires are broken down into
five different categories.

23
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:56,880
Class A, B, C, D, and K.

24
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:59,890
Class A fires consist of
solid combustible materials,

25
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:01,740
things like wood and paper.

26
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:03,780
To put out a Class A fire, you should use

27
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:05,540
a water-based extinguisher.

28
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:08,330
This extinguisher should have
green triangle label on it

29
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:09,960
so you can quickly identify it as

30
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,560
a water-based extinguisher.

31
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:13,985
I like to think of the green
triangle as a green tree

32
00:01:13,985 --> 00:01:17,110
since these Class A fires
are made up of tree products.

33
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:19,654
Things like wood and paper in most cases.

34
00:01:19,654 --> 00:01:22,490
Now you shouldn't use a
water-based extinguisher

35
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:24,450
in a server room because this could cause

36
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:26,387
a lot of damage to the
different components there

37
00:01:26,387 --> 00:01:29,320
as well as put you in
danger of an electric shock

38
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:30,790
when that water hits something that's

39
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:32,310
electrically charged.

40
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:35,590
The second type of fire is
known as a Class B fire.

41
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:39,130
Class B fires consist of
flammable gases or liquids.

42
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:41,200
To put out a Class B fire, you should use

43
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,770
a dry chemical agent or a
CO2-based fire extinguisher.

44
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:46,730
These are usually
labeled with a red square

45
00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:50,010
to signify that they can
be used on Class B fires.

46
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:52,938
Class C fires, on the other
hand, are electrical fires.

47
00:01:52,938 --> 00:01:54,950
If you encounter an electrical fire,

48
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:56,280
the first thing you should try to do

49
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,970
is shut off the power to the room

50
00:01:57,970 --> 00:01:59,330
because if you remove the power,

51
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:01,220
this could put out the fire for you.

52
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:03,800
If it doesn't, then you
need to extinguish that fire

53
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,290
with a fire extinguisher.

54
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:06,940
If you're going to use
a portable extinguisher

55
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:09,270
you should look for a
CO2-based extinguisher

56
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:12,900
or one with a blue circle
on it for Class C fires.

57
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,530
Next we have Class D fires
and these are made up

58
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:19,290
of combustible metals like
magnesium, titanium, and lithium.

59
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:20,360
Now, you might be wondering,

60
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,280
where am I going to find
these combustible metals

61
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,600
inside my office?

62
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:26,210
Well, most laptops have lithium batteries

63
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:28,420
so if you have a laptop
fire, you have to treat it

64
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:30,120
as a Class D fire.

65
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,340
To extinguish it, you should
look for an extinguisher

66
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:35,000
with a yellow decagon on
it and this extinguisher

67
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,720
is going to be fully yellow in color

68
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,680
so you can quickly and easily identify it.

69
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,230
Class K fires are composed of cooking oil.

70
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:43,830
So if your organization has a kitchen

71
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,080
inside of its facilities,

72
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,425
you should have a fire extinguisher system

73
00:02:46,425 --> 00:02:49,320
that's built-in to handle
grease and oil fires

74
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,100
that could occur during cooking.

75
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:54,040
This type of fire is
symbolized by a black hexagon

76
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:56,200
and the systems that are
going to extinguish them

77
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:59,030
have that black hexagon on them as well.

78
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:01,680
Now as you walk around your
office or your facilities,

79
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,730
you're likely going to
see one of three types

80
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:05,320
of portable extinguishers.

81
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,580
The first is an ABC extinguisher,

82
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:10,290
which uses dry chemicals to put out fires.

83
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:12,180
If possible, you should avoid using this

84
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:13,850
on computer equipment though because

85
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:16,360
the dry chemical is
corrosive and destructive

86
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,700
to computer and electrical components.

87
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:20,440
The second and probably most common type

88
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:23,170
you're going to see is
called a BC extinguisher,

89
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:25,790
which is used on B and C fires.

90
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:28,770
This most often uses
CO2 to put out a fire.

91
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:31,270
This is useful for both
gas fires, Class B,

92
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:33,960
and electrical fires,
Class C, and it's also safe

93
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,089
to use on computers.

94
00:03:35,089 --> 00:03:37,860
Be careful when using a
CO2 extinguisher though

95
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:39,520
because it will smother the fire by

96
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,880
displacing oxygen from it, which is great.

97
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,108
But if there's people close by

98
00:03:43,108 --> 00:03:45,572
it's going to take out that
oxygen that they need to breathe

99
00:03:45,572 --> 00:03:47,420
and people could have trouble breathing

100
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:49,330
if there's no oxygen in the room.

101
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:51,500
The third type is a yellow extinguisher

102
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:54,680
and these bottles are used
for Class D or metal fires.

103
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,610
These are less common
but you should be aware

104
00:03:56,610 --> 00:03:58,200
of where they are in case you need one

105
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,170
inside your organization.

106
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:02,550
Now in addition to the
handheld extinguishers

107
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:04,840
your facility might use a sprinkler system

108
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,684
to put out fires inside the office.

109
00:04:06,684 --> 00:04:10,320
Sprinkler systems can either
be wet pipe or dry pipe.

110
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,470
A wet pipe sprinkler
system means that there's

111
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:14,940
water already filling all
of the sprinkler pipes

112
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:17,690
and it's just waiting for
that little red glass bulb

113
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:20,130
to be broken or melt from a fire.

114
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:21,870
If that bulb melts or it's broken,

115
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:24,160
it's going to release the
water from the sprinkler system

116
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,860
into the office spaces to smother any fire

117
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:28,720
and release that heat.

118
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,650
Now in some facilities the
spaces can get really cold

119
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:34,150
and below freezing, especially
if you live in the north.

120
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:36,670
If you're in a warehouse
environment or some other

121
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:38,210
non-air-conditioned space,

122
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:40,120
you don't want water
sitting in these pipes

123
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,220
because they could freeze and crack.

124
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:43,880
If your facility has this issue

125
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:47,020
then you want to use a dry
pipe sprinkler system instead.

126
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:48,910
In this type of system,
the pipes are filled

127
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:52,120
with pressurized air and only
pushes water into those pipes

128
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,120
when it's needed to combat a fire.

129
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,279
This happens once that
little red bulb is broken,

130
00:04:56,279 --> 00:04:58,100
once again.

131
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:00,240
The third type of sprinkler
system is known as

132
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,140
a pre-action sprinkler system and

133
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:03,930
it's similar to a dry pipe system,

134
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:07,560
except it also can be set off
if heat or smoke is detected

135
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,780
and it won't wait until
there's a full fire

136
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:12,570
that causes that red
bulb to break or melt.

137
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:15,030
Now a pre-action sprinkler
system won't activate

138
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:17,480
if the pipe or the bulb
is broken by itself

139
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:20,000
because it still has
to detect heat or smoke

140
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,586
before it releases its
contents into the room.

141
00:05:22,586 --> 00:05:24,990
Now in most server rooms we don't want

142
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:26,250
to use a sprinkler system.

143
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:28,110
It's not a very good choice for us

144
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:30,580
and the reason is if somebody
sets off the sprinkler system

145
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:33,670
by accident, it would release
water into the server room

146
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:35,250
and it would destroy all of the servers

147
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:37,010
and other electrical components we have

148
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:39,060
by surrounding them with water.

149
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:40,950
Now for this reason, we're going to use

150
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:42,780
a special hazard protection system

151
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:44,670
instead of a sprinkler system.

152
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:46,260
This type of system is known as

153
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:47,960
a clean agent system and it will

154
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:50,330
push gas into the room instead

155
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:52,400
and that will allow it
to smother the fire.

156
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,130
This may be something like HALON,

157
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:55,470
which we don't use commonly anymore

158
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:56,550
here in the United States because

159
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:58,000
its bad for the environment.

160
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,030
Or something like FM-200
or even a CO2-based system.

161
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:03,610
If you're ever working in a server room

162
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:05,580
and you hear an alarm going off loudly,

163
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:07,420
you should immediately
drop what you're doing

164
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:09,438
and leave the room because this loud alarm

165
00:06:09,438 --> 00:06:12,370
is a warning that the gas
is about to be released

166
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:15,070
into the server room and
if you remain in that room

167
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:16,430
it's going to suffocate the fire

168
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:17,980
and it's going to suffocate you.

169
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:21,781
So you need to get out immediately
when you hear that noise.

170
