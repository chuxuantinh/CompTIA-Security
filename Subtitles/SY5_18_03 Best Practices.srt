1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:02,240
- In this lesson, we're
going to talk about

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:04,515
some of the best practices
for access control.

3
00:00:04,515 --> 00:00:05,750
There's several of them out there

4
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:06,850
that I want you to remember

5
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:08,160
and think about as you're setting up

6
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:09,810
your access control systems.

7
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:11,982
The first one is known as implicit deny.

8
00:00:11,982 --> 00:00:15,390
All access to a resource
should be denied by default,

9
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:18,020
and only allowed when
it's explicitly stated.

10
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:19,924
So for instance, when
I create a new folder,

11
00:00:19,924 --> 00:00:23,240
by default I want it to not
allow people to have access,

12
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,270
and then I would go ahead and give access

13
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:27,000
to the people that need access to it.

14
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,330
This gives you a higher
security environment.

15
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:30,500
Now, by default,

16
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:33,130
a lot of systems are
actually done the other way.

17
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:35,170
They're done where it's an explicit deny.

18
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:37,410
Everything is allowed until you deny it.

19
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:38,910
If you want to have a
secure system though,

20
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:41,070
you want to configure it as explicit deny.

21
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:43,070
You want to deny, deny, deny,

22
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:45,496
and only allow people in
that you want to have in.

23
00:00:45,496 --> 00:00:47,120
The next one we want to think about

24
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,670
is least privilege.

25
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:50,830
Users are only given the
lowest level of access

26
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:53,210
they need to perform their job functions.

27
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:54,043
This kind of goes back to,

28
00:00:54,043 --> 00:00:57,380
do I want them to be a user,
a power user, or an admin?

29
00:00:57,380 --> 00:01:00,130
Well, if they don't need all
the functions of an admin,

30
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:01,210
then don't make them an admin,

31
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:02,380
make them a power-user.

32
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:03,550
If they don't need the power-user,

33
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:04,760
then make them a regular user,

34
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:06,791
and take away as much
permissions as you can,

35
00:01:06,791 --> 00:01:09,210
to give people the least they need.

36
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:10,370
This is going to make sure that people

37
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:13,139
have what they need to do their
job, but not anything more.

38
00:01:13,139 --> 00:01:14,880
For example, let's say that

39
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,160
somebody works in sales or marketing.

40
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:20,050
Do they need to have access
to employee salary data?

41
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:22,830
Well, no, but if someone
works in accounting or HR,

42
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:24,190
they need that information.

43
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:26,280
The accountants need it
so they can pay the bills,

44
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,760
the HR guys need it so they can figure out

45
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,330
when you need a raise, right?

46
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:31,330
So you need to make sure
you segment people out

47
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:33,300
and give them the least
amount of permission possible

48
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:35,234
so that these things don't creep on you.

49
00:01:35,234 --> 00:01:36,990
Also, when you start thinking about this,

50
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:38,660
you got to think about all
the different personal data

51
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:40,260
that exists on your network, right?

52
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:41,330
So as an HR person,

53
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:43,397
you have access to tons
of personal information.

54
00:01:43,397 --> 00:01:45,008
People's social security numbers,

55
00:01:45,008 --> 00:01:46,280
their dates of birth,

56
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,870
their home address, their phone numbers,

57
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:49,070
all of that stuff.

58
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:51,278
But as an IT guy, I don't
need to know that stuff,

59
00:01:51,278 --> 00:01:53,740
and so I should be kept out of that area

60
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:55,550
because I don't need the personal data.

61
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:57,870
Again, this is the whole idea
of keeping those permissions

62
00:01:57,870 --> 00:01:59,190
as low as possible,

63
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:00,490
so that people don't creep around,

64
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:02,360
and get information they don't need.

65
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,610
The next best practice is

66
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:05,770
maintaining a separation of duties.

67
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:08,090
This means that you're going
to require more than one person

68
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:10,940
to conduct a sensitive task or operation.

69
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:12,380
So I'll give you a great example of this

70
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:13,580
from the corporate world.

71
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:14,848
If you look in the corporate world,

72
00:02:14,848 --> 00:02:17,780
they have lots of money in
their checking accounts, right?

73
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:19,470
Well, who's going to be
able to sign the checks

74
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:20,660
for a corporation,

75
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:22,862
and, does it only require
one person or two?

76
00:02:22,862 --> 00:02:26,250
Let's say that they were going
to write a check for $10,000,

77
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:28,250
that should probably have two signatures,

78
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:30,610
so that no one employee can
write themselves a check

79
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:32,800
for $10,000 and steal it.

80
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,680
So by having two-person integrity here,

81
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,340
by doing this separation of duties,

82
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:37,960
where you have a sign and a counter-sign,

83
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,230
you prevent fraud.

84
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:41,120
Well, we do the same thing in technology.

85
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,860
For example, you might set up your system

86
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:45,460
that any time someone wants
to download more that 5GB

87
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:46,600
from your share drive,

88
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,860
they need two administrators

89
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:50,410
to sign off on that using
digital credentials.

90
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:52,330
That can help you
prevent data loss, right?

91
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:54,070
We don't want somebody
downloading our entire share drive

92
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:55,760
and running off with all of our data.

93
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,530
That's the idea of separation of duties,

94
00:02:57,530 --> 00:02:59,800
is making sure that it
takes more than one person

95
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:02,570
to do some kind of critical operation.

96
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:04,120
Now the other thing with
separation of duties

97
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,920
is you can also implement
this using a single user,

98
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,800
by having someone who has
an admin and a user account.

99
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,060
Now, for example, I work on a daily basis

100
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:14,410
on my user account, which is called Jason,

101
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:15,940
but if I need to install a program,

102
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:17,870
I can't do that from Jason's account.

103
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:19,454
Instead I have to log-out,

104
00:03:19,454 --> 00:03:21,330
log-in as an administrator,

105
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:22,770
and then install the program.

106
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:24,330
Why do I do that to myself?

107
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:25,980
Why do I make my life hard?

108
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:28,120
Well, because it prevents
malware from spreading

109
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,630
if an infection occurs.

110
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:31,730
If Jason as a user is surfing the internet

111
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:33,520
and downloads a piece of malware,

112
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:36,140
it can only run as Jason, as the user,

113
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:37,510
and not as the admin.

114
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:39,160
So by forcing me to log-out,

115
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:41,770
and then install something
using admin permissions,

116
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:43,010
that going to prevent spreads,

117
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:45,117
and it is a form of separation of duties.

118
00:03:45,117 --> 00:03:47,586
Now in Windows, this type
of separation of duties

119
00:03:47,586 --> 00:03:51,290
can be done automatically using the UAC,

120
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:53,030
or User Account Controls.

121
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:55,080
We're going to talk about
that later in its own lesson

122
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,738
at the end of this section.

123
00:03:56,738 --> 00:03:59,230
Now the last best practice
I want to talk about here

124
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:00,860
is called job rotation.

125
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:03,390
This occurs where users are
cycled through various jobs

126
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:05,330
to learn the overall operations better,

127
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:08,030
it reduces their boredom, it
enhances their skill level,

128
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:10,716
and most importantly it
actually increases our security.

129
00:04:10,716 --> 00:04:12,540
Now, how does all this happen?

130
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:14,380
Well, job rotation helps the employee

131
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:16,904
become more well-rounded
and learn new skills.

132
00:04:16,904 --> 00:04:19,420
Let's say I took somebody
who is in the sale department

133
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:21,260
and now move over to the
marketing department.

134
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:22,750
And then maybe I move them from marketing

135
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:23,980
and they go into to HR,

136
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:25,650
and we just keep moving
people throughout the company

137
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:28,630
as they progress upwards
and across the organization.

138
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:30,450
They're learning new
skills everywhere they go

139
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:32,490
and bringing that organizational
knowledge with them.

140
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:33,940
This is great for the company,

141
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,650
but also it's great for security

142
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:37,614
because job rotation helps us identity

143
00:04:37,614 --> 00:04:41,265
theft, fraud and abuse
within the organization.

144
00:04:41,265 --> 00:04:42,424
How does it does that?

145
00:04:42,424 --> 00:04:44,600
Well, let's say that you were in IT,

146
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,700
and I moved you from IT

147
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:47,520
and put you someplace else for two weeks.

148
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,560
While you're gone,

149
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,480
somebody else is having to do your job.

150
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,652
If you were stealing information

151
00:04:51,652 --> 00:04:53,199
or weren't doing your job properly,

152
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:55,560
that person's going to be
able to figure that out.

153
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,080
That's the whole idea with job rotation,

154
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,930
is it forces additional security

155
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:01,270
and checks and balances into the system.

156
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:02,850
Another variation of job rotation

157
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:04,745
is known as mandatory vacation.

158
00:05:04,745 --> 00:05:08,330
Now mandatory vacation means
I require all of my employees

159
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:10,870
to take two weeks of
vacation every year, right?

160
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:12,460
Now, most of the companies do this

161
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:14,310
because they want you to have a good time,

162
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:16,400
and they want you to have
some time off and relax,

163
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,690
and recharge, and go to the beach,

164
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:19,510
and all of that kind of good stuff.

165
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:21,000
And I want that too, right?

166
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,290
But from a security standpoint,

167
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:24,810
by forcing those vacations
that means somebody else

168
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:26,750
has to come in and cover for your job,

169
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:28,340
and when they're covering for your job,

170
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:30,280
they may find the things
you've been doing wrong,

171
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:33,182
and doing all those things
that are theft to the company,

172
00:05:33,182 --> 00:05:35,470
fraud, and all those other issues.

173
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:37,380
That's the idea, and so large corporations

174
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:39,869
have really embraced this
idea of mandatory vacations,

175
00:05:39,869 --> 00:05:41,920
because it allows them to uncover things

176
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,120
that they wouldn't have
uncovered otherwise.
