1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,579
- To aid in the development
of our policies,

2
00:00:01,579 --> 00:00:04,120
standards, guidelines and procedures,

3
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:05,520
some organizations look to

4
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:07,499
enterprise security
architecture frameworks,

5
00:00:07,499 --> 00:00:10,750
as I mentioned back in the
first lesson of this section.

6
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:12,580
Now, for the purposes of this lesson,

7
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:15,200
we're going to look at four
of them fairly quickly.

8
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,340
First, we have the
Sherwood Applied Business

9
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:19,767
Security Architecture,
also known as SABSA.

10
00:00:19,767 --> 00:00:21,909
SABSA is a risk-driven architecture,

11
00:00:21,909 --> 00:00:24,300
and it seeks to consider
the security problem

12
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,819
by thinking about the what, where, when,

13
00:00:26,819 --> 00:00:29,530
why, who and how of a problem.

14
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:31,520
And they think about this as it intersects

15
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:33,000
with six different layers.

16
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,320
The operational, component, physical,

17
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:38,800
logical, conceptual and contextual layers.

18
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,960
Next, we'll consider COBIT.

19
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,840
COBIT stands for the Control Objectives

20
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,010
for Information and Related Technology.

21
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:47,270
And it's a security controlled
development framework

22
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:49,166
that divides IT into four domains.

23
00:00:49,166 --> 00:00:51,768
Plan and Organize, Acquire and Implement,

24
00:00:51,768 --> 00:00:55,300
Deliver and Support, and
Monitor and Evaluate.

25
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:57,000
Each of these domains is then broken down

26
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,540
into one of 34 other processes.

27
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:00,570
And this is very similar

28
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:02,150
to other service management frameworks.

29
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:04,920
Like ITIL or ISO 27000.

30
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,630
Next, let's take a quick look

31
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:09,968
at the NIST Special Publication 800-53.

32
00:01:09,968 --> 00:01:11,606
This is a security control framework

33
00:01:11,606 --> 00:01:13,988
developed by the U.S.
Department of Commerce.

34
00:01:13,988 --> 00:01:16,920
Each control is placed into
one of three categories.

35
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,840
It is technical,
operational or management.

36
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:20,720
We talked about this

37
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,610
back in our security controls lesson.

38
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:23,860
Each of these classes contains

39
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:25,580
numerous security controls as well.

40
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:27,520
And if you're working
for a Government Agency,

41
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,150
you're likely going to
be using the framework

42
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:32,669
that is the NIST Special
Publication 800-53.

43
00:01:32,669 --> 00:01:34,770
Now there's also an
international framework

44
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:36,300
for information securities standards.

45
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:38,629
And this is known as
the ISO 27,000 series.

46
00:01:38,629 --> 00:01:41,560
And it also has the same kind of concept.

47
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,968
Finally, let's talk a moment about ITIL.

48
00:01:43,968 --> 00:01:46,300
ITIL is a framework that used to be known

49
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:48,220
as the IT Infrastructure Library,

50
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:50,360
because it was very focused
on service operations

51
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,820
and security of your networks.

52
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,750
But it has grown into
something larger now,

53
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:55,160
with the new ITIL four.

54
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:57,328
ITIL is still the de facto standard

55
00:01:57,328 --> 00:01:59,100
for IT service management.

56
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:00,290
But now it's being expanded

57
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:01,360
to include all sorts of

58
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,020
other service based connections

59
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:04,520
that we have with our organizations,

60
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,940
to provide value to our end users.

61
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:09,560
These days you may not even
be running your own servers.

62
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:12,085
And yet you're still an
IT service organization.

63
00:02:12,085 --> 00:02:15,370
For example, we are a digital
services training company,

64
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:17,820
but we don't even run
our own website anymore.

65
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:19,210
Instead our partners do,

66
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:21,180
and we oversee those functions.

67
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:23,067
ITIL is very comprehensive
for organizations

68
00:02:23,067 --> 00:02:24,925
who may have their own servers,

69
00:02:24,925 --> 00:02:28,180
contracted services and
servers, and much more,

70
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:29,210
as their all integrated

71
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:30,780
into the single value chain

72
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:32,960
to support your users, and your customers.

73
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,430
Now for the security plus exam,

74
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:36,040
you don't need to know ITIL in depth.

75
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,670
But, I would recommend checking out

76
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:38,880
and ITIL four course,

77
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:41,230
because most employers
rely heavily on ITIL

78
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:42,210
for their operations.

79
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:44,730
And being able to discuss
ITIL, it's processes,

80
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:46,466
and it's concepts is a great thing to have

81
00:02:46,466 --> 00:02:49,170
in your back pocket
during a job interview.

82
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:51,907
After all, ITIL is the
language of IT operations,

83
00:02:51,907 --> 00:02:53,336
and as security professionals,

84
00:02:53,336 --> 00:02:55,787
we need to fit in to
that system effectively.

85
00:02:55,787 --> 00:02:58,040
Now, in the security plus exam,

86
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,070
you're not going to be asked

87
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:00,810
a lot of questions about frameworks.

88
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:02,650
But you should know that
there are frameworks

89
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:04,776
that exist, such as SABSA, COBIT,

90
00:03:04,776 --> 00:03:06,850
the NIST Special Publications,

91
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:09,140
ISO 27000 and ITIL.

92
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:11,435
On the exam, the most I
would expect you to see

93
00:03:11,435 --> 00:03:13,030
on the exam about frameworks,

94
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:14,630
is the fact that we use frameworks

95
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:16,685
as a basis for our
policies, our procedures

96
00:03:16,685 --> 00:03:17,593
and our standards.
