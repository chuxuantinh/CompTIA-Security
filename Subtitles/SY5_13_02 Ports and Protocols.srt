1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:02,970
- In security one of the
most important things

2
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:04,330
is to ensure that you understand,

3
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:07,140
what openings you have
created in your systems.

4
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:08,900
When it comes to computers and networks,

5
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:11,910
most of these openings are
going to be created by ports.

6
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:14,780
Now a port is simply a
logical communication endpoint

7
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:17,110
that exists on your
computer or your server.

8
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:19,170
For example, if you're
running a web server,

9
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:20,580
you're going to have port 80 open

10
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:22,090
and listening for inbound requests

11
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:23,890
from your potential visitors.

12
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:25,590
Now ports are classified as either

13
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:27,690
inbound or outbound ports.

14
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:30,120
An inbound port is used
when your computer or server

15
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:31,940
is listening for a connection.

16
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:33,440
Just as in my earlier example,

17
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,850
the web server had port 80
open, that's an inbound port.

18
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:38,490
It's just waiting for
somebody to come along

19
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:39,860
and connect to it.

20
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:42,590
An outbound port on the other
hand, is opened by a computer

21
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:44,590
whenever it wants to connect to a server.

22
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:46,450
If my computer is attempting
to make a connection

23
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:48,360
to your web server over port 80,

24
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:49,860
well, then my computer is going to open up

25
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:53,670
a random high number
port such as port 52363

26
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:56,450
and it's going to make an outbound
request to that web server.

27
00:00:56,450 --> 00:00:58,660
Now, what does all this
look like in the real world?

28
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:00,710
Well, let's look at an
example of how an inbound

29
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:03,000
and outbound port are used when my laptop

30
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,010
attempts to connect to a
remote server over SSH.

31
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:08,100
First, we have a server
at the top of the screen

32
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:10,310
and it has a public IP
address assigned to it,

33
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:12,420
and it's listening on port 22,

34
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:16,240
so port 22 is the inbound
port awaiting new connections.

35
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,830
And in this case, port 22 is open.

36
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:19,870
At the bottom of the screen,

37
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:22,260
I have my laptop that wants
to make the connection.

38
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:24,740
Now, my laptop has a
private IP address assigned

39
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:26,960
because my network is
using NAT at the router

40
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,010
and that gives me some
additional protections.

41
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:30,260
So, notice at this point

42
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:33,070
my laptop doesn't have
any ports opened yet.

43
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:34,470
So now my laptop wants to go

44
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:36,330
and establish the SSH connection.

45
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:38,790
It's going to open up an
outbound port on itself,

46
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:42,420
which is going to be some random
high number port like 51233

47
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:45,280
and it's going to send a
request to the SSH server

48
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,630
over port 22 which is
the server's inbound port

49
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:50,420
and destined for it's IP address

50
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:55,170
in this case, 46.124.63.13.

51
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:57,420
Now once a server receives this request,

52
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:58,710
it has to respond to it.

53
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:00,490
So, it's going to send a
packet of information back

54
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:03,630
to my laptop's IP in the
outbound port that was open.

55
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:07,270
In this case that's port
51233 and in reality

56
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:09,960
it would be the public facing
IP address of my router

57
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,400
but for our example, I'm going
to use the private IP address

58
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,200
of 192.168.1.45.

59
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,410
Now, that my laptop has made
the request to the server

60
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:20,120
and the server answered that request,

61
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,790
we now have a session established

62
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:25,060
and both devices can communicate
back and forth as needed.

63
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:26,430
Once that session is over,

64
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:27,860
the connection is going to be closed,

65
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:29,730
my laptop is going to
close it's outbound port

66
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:31,000
because it's no longer needed

67
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,630
and the server will keep
that inbound port open

68
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:35,840
so they can receive
requests from the next user

69
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,100
who wants to use it.

70
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:39,640
So now that we showed how
ports work in the real world,

71
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:42,190
let's talk a little bit more
about the ports themselves.

72
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:44,780
In addition to being called
inbound and outbound ports,

73
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:46,770
the ports are going to
be assigned a number.

74
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:51,600
Now, the number can be
anywhere between 0 and 65,535

75
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,520
but this big range is
actually divided into

76
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,080
three smaller groups.

77
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,550
The first group is called
the Well-Known ports.

78
00:02:57,550 --> 00:03:00,053
This is for any ports that
are between 0 and 1023.

79
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:02,640
These are called Well-Known ports

80
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,440
because they are designated by IANA

81
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,400
the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority

82
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,070
and they are going to
assign it to commonly used

83
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:09,570
protocols and ports.

84
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:12,420
Now, for example secure web
browsing is one we all know.

85
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:15,870
It's https and it uses port 443,

86
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:19,110
Telnet is another well-known
one, it's port 23.

87
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:21,110
Both of these are
considered well-known ports

88
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:23,080
as well as hundreds of others.

89
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,330
Now, the second group we
have is going to cover ports

90
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:29,670
from 1024 up to 49,151.

91
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:31,840
This range is called the registered ports

92
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,560
because they have to be used by vendors

93
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,240
for their own proprietary protocols

94
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,220
and each vendor is going to register them

95
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:39,490
with IANA prior to using them.

96
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:42,040
For example Microsoft has an SQL server

97
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:46,490
and it uses port 1433 which
is another registered port.

98
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:49,310
Another good example of this
is remote desktop protocol

99
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:51,500
which is a proprietary Microsoft protocol

100
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:54,990
called RDP. It operates on port 3389.

101
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:56,280
The third and final group

102
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,550
is called the dynamic and private ports.

103
00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:03,527
This uses the ports between
49,151 all the way up to 65,535.

104
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:07,660
These ports can be used by any application

105
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:11,200
at any time without having to
be registered with IANA first.

106
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,260
Now, this range is usually
used by your client

107
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:14,930
whenever it picks a
random high number port

108
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:16,010
for its application.

109
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:18,290
Anytime it wants to have a
temporary outbound connection

110
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:20,340
this is the range that it's going to use.

111
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:22,410
This is also commonly used in gaming

112
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:24,233
as well as instant message and chat.

113
00:04:25,164 --> 00:04:27,076
(soft music)
