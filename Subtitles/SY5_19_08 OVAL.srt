1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,400
- OVAL.

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:04,690
The Open Vulnerability
and Assessment Language,

3
00:00:04,690 --> 00:00:06,810
or OVAL as it's known, is a standard

4
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:08,560
that was designed to regulate the transfer

5
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:11,400
of secure public
information across networks

6
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:14,020
and the internet to
utilize any security tools

7
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:16,170
and services available at the time.

8
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:18,740
Now, what does this really
mean in layman's terms?

9
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:21,190
Well, OVAL is an attempt
to create a standard

10
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:23,440
way for vulnerability management software,

11
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,890
scanners and other tools
to share their data

12
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:28,590
with each other and with other programs.

13
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:30,540
Now, just like I can send you a photograph

14
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:32,760
saved as a JPEG file,
and pretty much every

15
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:34,560
program knows how to open it and display

16
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,560
that information
properly, because they all

17
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:38,420
understand what the
JPEG format looks like,

18
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:39,950
well, that's what OVAL does,

19
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:42,550
but for vulnerability
assessment information.

20
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:45,160
Now, OVAL is comprised
of two different parts.

21
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:46,850
There's a language component to it,

22
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:48,430
and an interpreter.

23
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:51,220
The OVAL Language is
written as an XML schema

24
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:53,390
that's used to define and
describe the information

25
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:55,200
that's being created by the OVAL Language,

26
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,480
and it's allowing it to be shared

27
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,640
among various programs and tools.

28
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,480
Now, the OVAL Interpreter
on the other hand

29
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,410
is a reference model that was developed

30
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:04,230
to make sure that the
information being passed

31
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:05,860
around by all of these programs,

32
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:07,800
it actually complies with the OVAL schemas

33
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,910
and definitions that the language created.

34
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:12,610
Because OVAL can be used
by lots of different tools,

35
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:15,460
it has become a large part
of vulnerability assessments,

36
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:17,900
patch management, auditing, the sharing

37
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:20,590
of threat indicators,
and multiple other uses.

38
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:22,210
Now, for the Security+ exam,

39
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:24,330
you just have to remember
that OVAL stands for

40
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:26,670
the Open Vulnerability
and Assessment Language,

41
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:28,540
and that it's used to
share data between lots

42
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:30,190
of different tools that are focused on

43
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:32,000
vulnerability assessments and management.

44
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,681
And if you do that, you're
going to do just fine.

45
00:01:34,681 --> 00:01:36,879
