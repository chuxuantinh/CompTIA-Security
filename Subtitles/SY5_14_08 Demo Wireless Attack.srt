1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:03,280
- In this lesson I'm going to
demonstrate how to conduct an

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:05,240
initialization vector attack on a

3
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:07,200
WEP protected access point.

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,060
As I said before, WEP is
extremely insecure because

5
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:13,100
it only uses a 24 bit
initialization vector.

6
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:15,970
Regardless of what key you
choose, this attack is going to

7
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:18,010
work every single time.

8
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:20,525
This is the reason that I say
you never, ever want to use

9
00:00:20,525 --> 00:00:21,990
WEP in your networks.

10
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:24,580
If you find a network using
WEP in your organization,

11
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:28,160
you should immediately work
to upgrade it to WPA2 instead.

12
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,960
Let's jump into the lab
and I'll show you exactly

13
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:31,070
how this works.

14
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:32,660
So the first thing we're going
to do is where you're going to

15
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:36,800
start with airodump-ng and
then the card that we have

16
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,123
which is wlan0mon.

17
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:41,365
And notice it's starting
to scan for that particular

18
00:00:41,365 --> 00:00:43,000
network that we're looking for.

19
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,290
In our case, we already found
it, it is wireless hacking.

20
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:48,600
This WEP network right here.

21
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:53,600
And this is the BSSID, or the
Mac address for that network.

22
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:58,290
So, for us to attack it, we are
going to use airodump-ng again.

23
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:02,660
And in this case we are
going to specifically tell it

24
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:06,370
which channel we want to go
after, which is channel one,

25
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:08,630
right here, from the
wireless hacking network.

26
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:12,240
We want to go after the
BSSID that was provided

27
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,810
for that network, and we want to go ahead

28
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:19,380
and write that data to a
file which is going to be

29
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:24,380
wireless hacking dump, is what
we're going to call that file.

30
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:26,790
And then we're going to
give it the card itself,

31
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:30,940
which is wlan0mon, and
hit enter, and off it goes

32
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:34,280
starting to scan the
network, which is helpful.

33
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,540
But we're not quite there yet.

34
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:38,450
Notice the data packets are
climbing, but we haven't yet

35
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:41,250
associated ourself to that
network to be able to start

36
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:43,860
doing things like packet
injection and capturing those

37
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:45,370
initialization vectors.

38
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:48,250
So I'm going to go ahead and
put this up here to make some

39
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:52,640
extra room and we'll just
bring that right across the top

40
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,090
and let it continue to run.

41
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:57,440
We're going to open up a new
terminal and I'm going to bring that

42
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,980
down here to the bottom.

43
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:03,010
Now, in the new terminal what
I need to do is I need to

44
00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:06,300
start doing a authentication
to the network using

45
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:10,700
fake authentication, which is
our first step in the hack.

46
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:14,850
So, that first step in the
hack is that we are going to do

47
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:18,613
a program called aireplay,
and in aireplay-ng,

48
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:23,730
we are going to use
fakeauth as our command,

49
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:27,750
zero for infinite attempts,
dash a and the Mac address

50
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:30,300
that we are going after,
which again we still

51
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:31,933
have pasted right there.

52
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:35,700
And then we're going to use
the Mac address that we are

53
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:39,410
coming from, which we
have to find ourself.

54
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:42,440
So we are going to open
up another terminal,

55
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,470
can see how you start getting
quite a few terminals,

56
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:47,190
and just type in something like ifconfig.

57
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:49,690
When you do that, you're
going to get the Mac address

58
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:54,690
for wlan0mon, and the first
12 digits here is that

59
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:57,540
Mac address for our network card.

60
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:02,070
So I'm just going to copy that
and then we can paste that in.

61
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:05,650
Now, this use dashes, but
for this particular command

62
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:08,400
you have to use colons, so
I'm going to arrow through

63
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,163
and change those to
colons, as you can see.

64
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:15,610
And the command's not done yet,
'cause what's the one thing

65
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:16,960
we haven't told it?

66
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:19,100
We haven't told it which card to use.

67
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:24,100
So we have to use wlan0mon,
and then we will hit enter,

68
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:27,460
and off it goes sending a authentication.

69
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:29,900
We not have an authentication
made with this network.

70
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:32,580
So we can move into the
second phase of our attack,

71
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:35,860
which is going to be the packet injection.

72
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:38,730
So, for the packet injection
we are going to still use

73
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:40,140
the aireplay command.

74
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:42,030
Most of it is going to be the
same, so what I'm going to do

75
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:44,130
instead of typing it
all is hit the up arrow,

76
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:46,680
which will bring back
the last command I used.

77
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,740
The big differences here
is we are not going to use

78
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:50,420
fake authentication anymore.

79
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:55,030
Instead, we want to use an
arpreplay so that we can create

80
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:57,670
additional traffic on this network.

81
00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:00,300
Instead of a for the access point,
we're going to use b for the

82
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:03,170
access point which tells
it that's the base station.

83
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:05,040
We're still going to use the
card that we're coming from

84
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,700
and the network card wlan0mon.

85
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:11,340
When we hit enter, off it
goes, and notice that we have

86
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:14,330
a couple of arp packets
here, and our data is

87
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:15,163
going to start going up.

88
00:04:15,163 --> 00:04:16,360
We have a lot of frame loss.

89
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,070
Once you have a couple
of arp requests that have

90
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:21,303
been successful, you can hit
Control + c and stop that.

91
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:24,670
Now, with this attack,
it does help if this

92
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:26,200
is a busy network.

93
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,090
Right now, as we're doing
this, you can see the

94
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:29,650
data packets are going up.

95
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:31,620
The reason those data packets
are going up is because

96
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:35,390
I'm streaming YouTube on the
device, this base station here,

97
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:40,240
which this client, which is
my iPhone, is talking to this

98
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,080
access point and streaming
YouTube, which is collecting

99
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,570
a lot of data.

100
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:47,160
Now, the next thing you want
to do is start cracking.

101
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:51,170
Every 5,000 data packets that
go up, it will start trying

102
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:52,630
to do another attempt.

103
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:56,280
It's really easy, you just
use aircrack-ng, and then the

104
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:59,233
file name of what you're
going to be using.

105
00:04:59,233 --> 00:05:04,233
Let me clear the screen here,
and the file that I'm going to

106
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:09,260
be using is wirelesshackingdump-02.cap.

107
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:10,910
The reason it's the second
one's 'cause I've run this

108
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:12,780
attempt once before showing you.

109
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:16,150
So, all we're going to use
is aircrack-ng and then the

110
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:19,660
file name that you're
going after, and hit enter.

111
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:21,720
Off it goes, starting to crack away.

112
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:25,560
Right now it already has
14,000 initialization vectors

113
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,630
collected, and you can see
that here from the data,

114
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:28,950
but that wasn't enough.

115
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:32,080
So when this hits 15,000, you're
going to see this kick off

116
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,840
again without me doing
anything, and we'll see if we

117
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,570
can crack that key.

118
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:37,760
So here it goes again.

119
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:40,670
It's going off and testing
the different keys.

120
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:41,630
And it didn't find it.

121
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:43,800
So it'll try again at 20,000.

122
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,160
Generally, it's going to
find it somewhere between

123
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,680
10,000 and 25,000.

124
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:51,710
It really depends on where
that particular key is inside

125
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:54,710
the key space, depending
on what that hexadecimal

126
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:56,053
password was that we used.

127
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:04,240
So again, you can see the
data packets climbing up

128
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,290
as I'm streaming different YouTube videos.

129
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:07,940
Every time I start another video it starts

130
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:09,410
downloading all that data.

131
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:12,560
All those frames have an
initialization vector in there,

132
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,210
and they're able to be
captured so that we can

133
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:16,050
start seeing that information.

134
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:17,380
So now we have over 20,000.

135
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:19,480
It's going to try again and there it is.

136
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,680
It found our key.

137
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:24,520
17, 25, 83, A-E-F-A.

138
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,460
So, we now have a key.

139
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:27,730
What are we going to do with it?

140
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:30,260
Well, the next thing we want
to do is we want to see if that

141
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:33,480
key actually works and be
able to get onto a network.

142
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,220
We can do that through
Kali or we can do it

143
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:37,760
through your Windows
machine or your Mac machine,

144
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:40,060
it depends on what
you're ultimate goal is.

145
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:42,580
For this example, I'm going
to show you how to use it

146
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:45,610
inside your Macintosh machine.

147
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:48,862
You can do the same thing in
Windows, and again in Kali.

148
00:06:48,862 --> 00:06:52,310
If we can cancel this
capturing at this point,

149
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:55,080
so we'll hit Control + c, and
we're going to switch back

150
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:58,570
to our client machine,
in my case Macintosh.

151
00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:01,740
So now that we're back
on our Windows or our

152
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:03,720
Macintosh machine, you'll connect to that

153
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,790
wireless network just
like you normally do.

154
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:07,990
So we're going to go down to
wireless hacking, and it's

155
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:09,825
going to ask us for the passcode.

156
00:07:09,825 --> 00:07:14,825
My passcode that we just
cracked was 17, 25, 83, A-E-F-A,

157
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:20,990
and if I go ahead and join,
we should see if I can pull

158
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:23,350
an IP address from this network.

159
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:26,490
And if we look at it, you can
see here we did pull and IP

160
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:29,610
address from this network,
and we are connected to that

161
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:34,060
access point starting
with c8 a7, that BSSID,

162
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:36,930
which is the one for wireless hacking.

163
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:40,009
So, our hack did work
and it was successful.

164
00:07:40,009 --> 00:07:42,029
