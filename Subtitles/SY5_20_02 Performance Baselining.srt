1
00:00:01,070 --> 00:00:02,800
- We've already mentioned
the word baselining

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:04,430
several times throughout the course,

3
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:07,280
but now we're going to take
some time to formally define it

4
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:09,020
and explore that concept a bit more

5
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:11,650
because it's really important
in the world of monitoring.

6
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:13,980
First, what is a baselining process?

7
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:16,020
Well, it's a process of measuring changes

8
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:19,280
in networking, hardware,
software, or applications.

9
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:22,100
If we know what the
baseline is, what is normal,

10
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:24,186
we can then see what is abnormal.

11
00:00:24,186 --> 00:00:26,230
Now, baselining our
network is really important

12
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:28,550
because it's going to
define what normal is.

13
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:29,890
By defining what normal is,

14
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:31,540
it allows us to monitor for changes

15
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:32,980
and report on those changes

16
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:35,970
whenever we find something
that's anomalous or abnormal.

17
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:38,800
This brings us to the concept
of baseline reporting.

18
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,450
Baseline reporting is the process

19
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:42,930
of documenting and
reporting on the changes

20
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:44,740
that you find in a baseline.

21
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:47,420
So if I said that this computer
was a Windows 10 machine

22
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:48,940
with these five apps on it,

23
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:50,980
and now you find that there are six apps,

24
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:52,540
that is something we'd have to report

25
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:54,910
because it's outside the normal baseline.

26
00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:57,700
We also have a baseline for
the system that we create

27
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:59,750
as part of our security posture.

28
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:02,420
Now a security posture is
basically the risk level

29
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:04,390
to which a system or
other technology element

30
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:06,380
is going to be exposed.

31
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:08,560
This type of baselining is usually tied up

32
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,680
in the concept of
configuration management,

33
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,260
and the patch levels that we use,

34
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:13,470
and the programs we install,

35
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:15,520
and the way we configure our devices

36
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,550
all are down in an effort
to meet a certain risk level

37
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:20,990
we want to meet or a
certain security posture.

38
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:23,870
If it's a server and we want to
have it as a low-risk server,

39
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:25,830
we're going to have to make
sure everything is fully updated

40
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:28,610
and we control specifically
every application,

41
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:32,090
every port, and every configuration
item inside that server.

42
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:33,850
Now if I'm dealing with your mobile phone,

43
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:36,170
I may be willing to accept
a higher risk level,

44
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:37,003
and I don't care if you're

45
00:01:37,003 --> 00:01:38,890
going to install Angry Birds on it or not.

46
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:41,170
That might be something that
I'm going to allow to happen,

47
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:43,540
and even though that might
put me in a higher risk level,

48
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:45,820
that's okay because it
matches the security posture

49
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:47,739
for that particular device.

50
00:01:47,739 --> 00:01:50,950
Now this lesson was called
Performance Baselining,

51
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:51,910
why is that?

52
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:53,670
Well, it's because performance baselining

53
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:55,680
is one of the most common
types of monitoring

54
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,600
that you're going to find
in your organization.

55
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,080
With performance baselining,

56
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:02,250
we're really focused on
operations and functionality.

57
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:04,140
So, it's not as much of a security issue

58
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:05,340
in most organizations.

59
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:07,770
We're looking at how much are
the processors being used?

60
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:09,610
How much is the network
bandwidth being used?

61
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:11,340
How much disk space is being used?

62
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:14,200
All of that stuff is
performance baselining.

63
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:17,030
But, in security, it's also important

64
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:18,160
to look at this stuff.

65
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,120
Why is that?

66
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,730
Well, if you start seeing a processor

67
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:23,860
that's being overtaxed and
it's using a lot of resources,

68
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:27,270
it may be not that here's an
additional load coming in,

69
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:29,690
but it may be that you have
malware on that machine.

70
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:31,220
That's something that's
going to be an indicator

71
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:32,510
that you would then investigate.

72
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:34,360
So again, having that normal baseline

73
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,280
and then seeing what is abnormal,

74
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,710
what are those spikes?

75
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:39,000
That is where we're going to investigate

76
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,020
and go, why are we seeing those spikes?

77
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:42,420
So as you can see here on the screen,

78
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:45,170
this technician has his
finger on one of those spikes,

79
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:46,280
and we would look at that time of day

80
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,880
and go, why is there a
spike in network traffic?

81
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,440
Is somebody trying to steal our files?

82
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,460
If that spike happened
at three in the morning,

83
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:53,840
I would want to know why.

84
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,450
If it happened at noon,
I can probably guess why.

85
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:58,380
People are sitting at their
desk and playing on Facebook

86
00:02:58,380 --> 00:02:59,630
because it's lunch time.

87
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:02,440
So again, looking into those
things that are anomalous

88
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,820
and outside the normal band

89
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:05,870
will allow you to figure
out what is normal,

90
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:08,190
what is not, and what is a security risk

91
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:09,490
and what is not.

92
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:11,350
Now to do performance monitoring,

93
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:13,520
you can do this lots of different ways.

94
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,100
One of the ways that most people use

95
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:17,150
is a tool called Performance Monitor.

96
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:18,780
It's a tool in Windows that you can use

97
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:20,010
to monitor the performance

98
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:22,450
of an individual server or workstation.

99
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:23,330
You can check things like

100
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:24,980
the processing power being utilized,

101
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:26,490
the amount of memory being utilized,

102
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:27,470
the amount of disk space,

103
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:30,120
the network utilization,
and other things like that.

104
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,470
You can also set it up
to create reports for you

105
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:35,320
and then get those off and
compare those in the future.

106
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:39,230
Now, to get this tool, you're
going to use Perfmon.exe,

107
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:42,030
which is the Windows program
for the performance monitor.

108
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:43,010
If you go to a command prompt

109
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:44,770
and type in Perfmon and hit enter,

110
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:46,520
it will bring up the performance monitor

111
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:49,630
and you can see how your
system is currently performing.

112
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:51,710
Now the performance
monitor and other tools

113
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:53,420
will allow you to also create reports,

114
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:54,770
as I mentioned before.

115
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:57,990
This is useful to go back and
analyze the details afterwards

116
00:03:57,990 --> 00:03:59,350
to see what was going wrong,

117
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:01,940
but it's not going to
be useful in real time.

118
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:04,180
Instead, you need to set up proper alerts

119
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:06,930
and notifications so you
get an instant notification

120
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:09,440
to an administrator when
some predefined thresholds

121
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,950
are breached by the system.

122
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:12,900
For example, you might say that anytime

123
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:15,580
the server starts going
over 80% utilization,

124
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:17,330
the administrator should be notified.

125
00:04:17,330 --> 00:04:20,630
Or, anytime the network
utilization goes over 95%.

126
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:22,880
Whatever those thresholds
are in your organization,

127
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,290
you're going to have to define that.

128
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:25,470
But once you have those set,

129
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:27,550
you can then figure out what it is,

130
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:28,800
and you're going to be notified

131
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,930
so you can look into those things

132
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:31,390
that become anomalous events

133
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:33,060
to figure out if it's an issue

134
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:35,597
or if it's normal operations.

135
00:04:35,597 --> 00:04:37,807
(electronic tones)
