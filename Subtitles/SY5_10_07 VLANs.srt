1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:02,170
- Switches can also provide the ability

2
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:04,510
to create virtual local area networks.

3
00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:06,990
This adds a layer of
separation to our networks

4
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:09,540
without requiring us to
buy additional switches

5
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:12,130
that have to be configured
and installed on the network.

6
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:14,450
VLANs are implemented
to segment our network,

7
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:17,020
reduce collisions, organize our networks,

8
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:19,450
boost performance and increase security.

9
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:22,450
Unfortunately attackers
have created VLAN hopping

10
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:24,420
which allows them to
break out of our VLANs

11
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:26,630
and access other VLAN data though.

12
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:28,680
There's a couple of mechanisms to do this.

13
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:31,310
The first method is
known as switch spoofing.

14
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:33,590
In this attack, an attacker
essentially configures

15
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:35,600
their device to pretend that it's a switch

16
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,010
and they connect to a switch port

17
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:40,710
to negotiate a trunk link
and break out of the VLAN.

18
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:43,640
To prevent this, you can disable
dynamic trunking protocol

19
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:46,290
or DTP on all your switch ports,

20
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:49,360
place all your unplugged
ports into an unused VLAN,

21
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,920
explicitly forward frames

22
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:53,400
and avoid default VLAN names.

23
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:56,310
The second method is what's
known as double tagging.

24
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:58,260
As traffic goes across a switch,

25
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:00,600
it reads the outermost VLAN tag first,

26
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,590
strips it off and then routes the traffic

27
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:04,050
to the proper VLAN.

28
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:05,280
In double tagging though,

29
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,870
an attacker actually adds two VLAN tags,

30
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:10,000
an outer tag and an inner tag,

31
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,220
so as traffic goes
through the first switch,

32
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:13,600
it removes the outer tag

33
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,840
and is then forwarded to the
destination of the inner tag.

34
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:19,120
You can prevent this by
moving all the ports out

35
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,573
of the default VLAN group.

36
00:01:20,573 --> 00:01:22,640
Double tagging can also be prevented

37
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,510
by upgrading your switch's firmware,

38
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:27,400
utilizing an unused
VLAN as the default VLAN

39
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,563
and redesigning the VLAN structures.
