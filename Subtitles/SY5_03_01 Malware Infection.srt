1
00:00:00,978 --> 00:00:02,339
- In this section of the course,

2
00:00:02,339 --> 00:00:04,903
we're going to talk
about malware infections,

3
00:00:04,903 --> 00:00:07,815
because malware doesn't just
appear on your computer.

4
00:00:07,815 --> 00:00:10,195
It doesn't just show up out of thin air.

5
00:00:10,195 --> 00:00:11,945
Somebody has to deliver it somehow

6
00:00:11,945 --> 00:00:13,869
and install it on your machine.

7
00:00:13,869 --> 00:00:16,597
Malware can be delivered
in lots of different ways,

8
00:00:16,597 --> 00:00:19,506
including through software,
messaging and media,

9
00:00:19,506 --> 00:00:21,479
from a botnet or zombies.

10
00:00:21,479 --> 00:00:23,146
It can have activate interception

11
00:00:23,146 --> 00:00:25,285
that's going to put
malware into your network,

12
00:00:25,285 --> 00:00:27,243
or it can have a privilege escalation.

13
00:00:27,243 --> 00:00:28,181
Where somebody goes from being

14
00:00:28,181 --> 00:00:32,032
a regular user to a super user
and infects your computer.

15
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:34,761
Also, there's back doors and logic bombs.

16
00:00:34,761 --> 00:00:36,087
There is a lot of different ways

17
00:00:36,087 --> 00:00:39,335
to get malicious software
onto your machine.

18
00:00:39,335 --> 00:00:41,638
In fact, one of the
simplest delivery methods

19
00:00:41,638 --> 00:00:44,445
is when somebody has physical
access to your machine

20
00:00:44,445 --> 00:00:46,263
and plugs in something like a thumb drive

21
00:00:46,263 --> 00:00:48,045
that's already infected.

22
00:00:48,045 --> 00:00:50,014
So, when we think about malware

23
00:00:50,014 --> 00:00:51,443
there's really two pieces of how

24
00:00:51,443 --> 00:00:53,692
malware gets onto your machine.

25
00:00:53,692 --> 00:00:56,584
The first, is what we
call a threat vector.

26
00:00:56,584 --> 00:00:59,201
A threat vector is the
method used by an attacker

27
00:00:59,201 --> 00:01:01,510
to access a victims machine.

28
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:04,706
Some examples of threat
vectors are unpatched software,

29
00:01:04,706 --> 00:01:07,948
installation from a USB thumb
drive, a fishing campaign,

30
00:01:07,948 --> 00:01:10,017
where one of your users clicks on a link

31
00:01:10,017 --> 00:01:12,342
to install a program, and many other

32
00:01:12,342 --> 00:01:14,202
different methods that are out there.

33
00:01:14,202 --> 00:01:16,241
After we figure out what
the threat vector is

34
00:01:16,241 --> 00:01:19,685
the next piece is what we
call the attack vector.

35
00:01:19,685 --> 00:01:22,364
An attack vector is the
means by which the attacker

36
00:01:22,364 --> 00:01:24,364
is going to gain access to that computer,

37
00:01:24,364 --> 00:01:26,703
in order to affect you with malware.

38
00:01:26,703 --> 00:01:29,479
Now I know these two
terms sound very similar,

39
00:01:29,479 --> 00:01:31,548
but there is a key difference.

40
00:01:31,548 --> 00:01:34,357
A threat vector is how we
get to the machine itself,

41
00:01:34,357 --> 00:01:35,884
but the attack vector includes

42
00:01:35,884 --> 00:01:37,773
both the way we got to the machine

43
00:01:37,773 --> 00:01:39,786
and how we're going to infect it.

44
00:01:39,786 --> 00:01:41,325
Let me provide you an example,

45
00:01:41,325 --> 00:01:44,103
to hopefully simply
this just a little bit.

46
00:01:44,103 --> 00:01:46,272
Let's pretend that your
house is a computer

47
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:49,351
and I have a cupcake that's
going to represent malware.

48
00:01:49,351 --> 00:01:51,976
My job as the attacker
is to get the cupcake

49
00:01:51,976 --> 00:01:54,112
from my house to your house

50
00:01:54,112 --> 00:01:56,063
and put it on your kitchen table.

51
00:01:56,063 --> 00:01:58,299
Now, that's my goal, as the attacker.

52
00:01:58,299 --> 00:02:00,441
You are going to try
and defend against it.

53
00:02:00,441 --> 00:02:02,669
The threat vector I use might be that

54
00:02:02,669 --> 00:02:04,228
I can drive right up to your house,

55
00:02:04,228 --> 00:02:06,426
because your house isn't
inside a gated community

56
00:02:06,426 --> 00:02:08,866
and there's no security
guards looking for me.

57
00:02:08,866 --> 00:02:12,061
This would be a threat vector,
your unguarded neighborhood.

58
00:02:12,061 --> 00:02:13,804
Now if I walk up to your door,

59
00:02:13,804 --> 00:02:14,974
and I start picking your lock,

60
00:02:14,974 --> 00:02:15,966
and I enter your house,

61
00:02:15,966 --> 00:02:18,594
and I place the cupcake
on your kitchen table,

62
00:02:18,594 --> 00:02:20,573
this represents the attack vector.

63
00:02:20,573 --> 00:02:23,222
It's all the things I did
from driving to your house,

64
00:02:23,222 --> 00:02:24,779
to picking your lock,

65
00:02:24,779 --> 00:02:28,809
and delivering that poison
cupcake onto your kitchen table.

66
00:02:28,809 --> 00:02:29,687
That's the difference between

67
00:02:29,687 --> 00:02:32,858
the threat vector and the attack vector.

68
00:02:32,858 --> 00:02:35,833
Now, let's go back to the world
of computers for a moment.

69
00:02:35,833 --> 00:02:37,643
Let's pretend that you
have an old computer

70
00:02:37,643 --> 00:02:39,925
that's running Windows 7
and you haven't bothered

71
00:02:39,925 --> 00:02:42,274
installing or downloading
the latest security patches,

72
00:02:42,274 --> 00:02:45,146
because you've just been
busy and haven't had time.

73
00:02:45,146 --> 00:02:46,794
Well, maybe you haven't
installed these patches,

74
00:02:46,794 --> 00:02:48,626
in quite a long while.

75
00:02:48,626 --> 00:02:51,512
So you have a computer that's
missing a critical patch,

76
00:02:51,512 --> 00:02:56,419
like the Microsoft 17-010
patch, which came out in 2017.

77
00:02:56,419 --> 00:02:58,392
This was an essential security patch

78
00:02:58,392 --> 00:03:02,536
for the EternalBlue vulnerability,
this is a threat vector.

79
00:03:02,536 --> 00:03:04,264
This is your unpatched computer,

80
00:03:04,264 --> 00:03:08,319
but I don't yet have an
attack vector, not yet.

81
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:10,370
Now, as an attacker, I'm sitting there

82
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:11,736
and I'm scanning the internet.

83
00:03:11,736 --> 00:03:13,336
I'm trying to find unpatched computers

84
00:03:13,336 --> 00:03:15,594
and lo and behold I find your computer

85
00:03:15,594 --> 00:03:18,520
and I determine that it's
missing this critical patch

86
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,156
and therefore, you're vulnerable

87
00:03:20,156 --> 00:03:22,847
to an exploit against your
file and printer services,

88
00:03:22,847 --> 00:03:25,071
which are known as SMB.

89
00:03:25,071 --> 00:03:26,291
Once I run this exploit,

90
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:28,808
I'm going to be able to
gain access to your machine

91
00:03:28,808 --> 00:03:31,049
and install some kind of malware on it.

92
00:03:31,049 --> 00:03:34,339
This series of events now
becomes my attack vector.

93
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:36,878
In fact, this is the
exact same attack vector

94
00:03:36,878 --> 00:03:39,558
that was used by the WannaCry ransomware.

95
00:03:39,558 --> 00:03:41,431
What they ended up doing was
they searched the internet

96
00:03:41,431 --> 00:03:43,236
for unpatched Windows machines,

97
00:03:43,236 --> 00:03:46,998
and when they found them that
were missing the patch 17-010

98
00:03:46,998 --> 00:03:48,777
they ran an exploit against them

99
00:03:48,777 --> 00:03:52,007
to gain administrative rights
and encrypt the users files

100
00:03:52,007 --> 00:03:54,868
and then post a message
saying, "Your computer's locked

101
00:03:54,868 --> 00:03:56,522
and if you want to get the access to it,

102
00:03:56,522 --> 00:03:58,643
you're going to pay me some money."

103
00:03:58,643 --> 00:04:00,422
In this section, we're going to look at

104
00:04:00,422 --> 00:04:02,760
various infection vectors
that malware uses.

105
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,323
As well as, how to prevent malware

106
00:04:04,323 --> 00:04:06,272
from being installed on your system.

107
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:08,330
Also, we'll cover how to remove malware

108
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:10,184
if it does find it's way in.

109
00:04:10,184 --> 00:04:12,101
So, let's get started.
