1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,313
- SIM cloning, and ID theft.

2
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:05,610
If you've gone and bought
a new cell phone recently,

3
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:06,930
you've gone to the store,

4
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:09,070
they've pulled out a little
chip out of your phone,

5
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:11,120
and placed it into your new phone.

6
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:12,670
What is that chip?

7
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:14,380
Well, that's a SIM card.

8
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:17,420
It stands for Subscriber Identity Module.

9
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:20,190
This is an integrated
circuit that securely stores

10
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:22,640
the international mobile
subscriber identity,

11
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,680
your IMSI number and its related key.

12
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,830
This is what tells the cellphone towers

13
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:30,840
which device is assigned to which number.

14
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:33,540
Now, if someone is able
to clone your SIM card,

15
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:35,350
they can pretend they're you.

16
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:38,290
This was very popular in
the early days of cellphones

17
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:40,480
because if I could pretend that I was you,

18
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,970
I could rack up lots
of long-distance calls

19
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:44,900
and lots of minutes used on cellular,

20
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:46,120
and not get charged for 'em

21
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,900
because, you would get charged for 'em.

22
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:51,160
And so people would go
through and impersonate you

23
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:53,870
and they would do this
by cloning your SIM card.

24
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:56,410
Now SIM cloning allows two cell phones

25
00:00:56,410 --> 00:00:58,340
to utilize the same service

26
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:00,140
and allows the attacker to gain access

27
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:01,990
to the phone's personal data.

28
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:03,990
So if I'm cloning your SIM card

29
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:05,730
the towers think I'm you.

30
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:07,540
So when somebody sends you a text message,

31
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:09,550
I get a copy and you get a copy.

32
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:12,140
And so now I'm able to keep
track of what you're getting.

33
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:14,460
Now this is very dangerous for you,

34
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:17,730
the good news is that
SIM has changed it's ways

35
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:18,700
over the years.

36
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:20,330
The first versions of SIM cards

37
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:21,870
were very easy to clone,

38
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:23,700
but the newer SIM version two cards

39
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:25,650
are much much harder.

40
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:28,810
So this gives us a lot more security.

41
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:31,630
Now one of the second problems
we have with mobile phones

42
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:33,380
and SIM cards and phone numbers,

43
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:35,950
is when people try to
take over your phone.

44
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:37,810
And so you may think alright, great,

45
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:40,220
SIM card cloning is almost
a thing of the past,

46
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:42,110
version two has taken care of it.

47
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:43,870
Well, attackers are smart,

48
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:47,380
and they find other ways to
hijack your cell phone account.

49
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:49,020
What they started doing now

50
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:51,550
is they will call up
your cell phone provider

51
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:53,080
and pretend to be you.

52
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:55,020
This is a social engineering scheme.

53
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:57,150
They'll say I just bought a new phone

54
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:59,020
and I need to get it activated.

55
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:01,340
And the nice customer
service agent will ask them

56
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:03,140
some basic questions about themselves,

57
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:04,690
like maybe their date of birth,

58
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:05,790
where they went to high school,

59
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:07,150
their name and address,

60
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:09,250
things that you can usually find online.

61
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:10,730
So the attacker pretends to be you

62
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:12,310
and gives that information,

63
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:15,090
the customer service agent
is wonderfully helpful,

64
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:17,100
and they transfer your phone service

65
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:19,160
from you to the attacker.

66
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,920
Now the attacker has a phone

67
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:24,140
and a new SIM card that is
now attached to your number.

68
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:25,210
Why are they doing this?

69
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:27,100
Why do they want your phone number?

70
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:30,210
Well, it comes down to
two step authentication.

71
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:33,710
A lot of websites now are using
two factor authentication.

72
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:36,370
Where you log in and then
they send you a text message

73
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:37,950
with a secret code

74
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:39,930
that you then put into
the website to verify

75
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:41,550
you are who you say your are.

76
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:44,580
If the attacker is able to
take over your phone number,

77
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:45,960
they can now pretend to be you

78
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:48,830
and log into your bank,
your Facebook, your Gmail,

79
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:50,170
or whatever else you have

80
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,890
for two factor authentication.

81
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:54,380
This is becoming a big problem,

82
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:55,840
and so you have to be careful

83
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,610
where you post your phone number.

84
00:02:57,610 --> 00:02:59,900
Because if somebody now
has your phone number,

85
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:01,370
and they've already stolen your account,

86
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:03,910
your email and maybe your password,

87
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:05,660
they can now take over your phone number

88
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:07,040
and then take over your accounts.

89
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:11,030
So this is what we call ID
theft, or account takeover.

90
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:13,080
So, how do we combat this?

91
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,180
Well, one of the ways is to be careful

92
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:17,100
where you post your phone number.

93
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:19,160
Because if you are a
victim of a data breach

94
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:22,230
and somebody has stolen
your name and your address

95
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:23,250
and your email,

96
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:25,100
and now they have your phone number,

97
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:27,800
they can perform this
account takeover against you,

98
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,980
and now they're going to be
able to log into your accounts

99
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:30,880
as if they were you,

100
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:34,200
even if you had the two
factor authentication set up.

101
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,610
So, what do we recommend to bypass this

102
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:38,630
if you really want to be paranoid?

103
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:41,250
Well, you can go and get
a google voice number

104
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:42,730
or something of that nature.

105
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:45,060
Where you have a single phone
number that people call,

106
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:47,760
and then nobody knows your
actual cell phone number

107
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,050
that's behind it.

108
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:50,960
You then can use that cell phone number

109
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:53,700
to validate your accounts for
two factor authentication.

110
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,980
Again, this is getting a little paranoid

111
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:58,190
but this is something that
some people are worried about

112
00:03:58,190 --> 00:03:59,320
and are taking this action

113
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,770
and these steps to bypass it.
