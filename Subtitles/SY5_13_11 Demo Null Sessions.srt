1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:02,620
- In this demonstration,
I'm going to show you

2
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:04,510
how a null session is created.

3
00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:05,470
But you may be wondering,

4
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:07,480
what exactly is a null session?

5
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:09,420
Well, a null session
is a connection to the

6
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:11,870
Windows interprocess communications share

7
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:14,200
known as the IPC dollar sign.

8
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,670
This is an administrative
share that you don't see

9
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:18,990
as a normal user, but it allows computers

10
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:21,430
across the network to send
information that they know

11
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:25,080
about files, folders,
users, groups, computers

12
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:27,000
and servers to each other.

13
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,950
Now, as an attacker, if
you're able to create

14
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:31,460
a null connection to a
computer, you can use that

15
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:33,100
as part of your information gathering

16
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:35,820
and enumeration and be able
to use all of that data

17
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:37,760
as part of your follow on attack.

18
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,120
So if a null connection
can give you access to all

19
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:42,540
of this information,
how easy is it to really

20
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:44,240
get a null connection set up?

21
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:46,310
Well you can do it with one line of code

22
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:47,680
inside the command line.

23
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:48,840
As I'm going to show you here,

24
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,220
using my Windows 10 machine,

25
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:51,843
over a local area network.

26
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:55,310
So here I am at the command prompt.

27
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:57,500
To do a null connection,
all you have to use

28
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,220
is the net use command.

29
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:02,680
Net space use and then the ip address

30
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:04,210
that you want to connect to.

31
00:01:04,210 --> 00:01:07,071
In my case, that's 10.0.2.15

32
00:01:07,071 --> 00:01:09,348
and then slash ipc$

33
00:01:09,348 --> 00:01:12,120
to connect to that administrative share

34
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:14,170
the inner process communication.

35
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:17,420
Now, from there you're going
to use a space, two quotes,

36
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:19,900
which is going to say
that you have no password,

37
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:23,760
the slash u for the user
and then two more quotes,

38
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,540
which says you have no user.

39
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:27,760
It's a blank user and a blank password.

40
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:30,620
If you hit enter, now that
you have this connection,

41
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:33,130
you can start gathering
information such as the users

42
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:36,760
and the groups, the files, the
shares, the local resources,

43
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:39,870
all of that using other tools
that a penetration tester

44
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:41,910
or hacker might use.

45
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:43,760
So now that you've seen
how easy it is to create

46
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,550
a null connection, you may be wondering,

47
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:48,540
what can I do to stop this
from being used against me?

48
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:51,470
Well, for one, on your
local machine if you block

49
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:55,490
port 445 and 139, this
is going to block smb,

50
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:58,900
your file sharing, as
well as port 139 net bios

51
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:00,970
and both of these ports
are used heavily to

52
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:03,450
get information from your
machine and do things

53
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:05,060
like enumeration such as when you're

54
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:06,320
using the null session.

55
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,530
So this will be your first
step in blocking someone

56
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:09,600
from getting there.

57
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,620
The second thing you can
do, is you can install

58
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:13,630
an IPS at your boundary.

59
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:15,500
This will prevent anyone
from outside your network

60
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:18,540
trying to make a null connection
in to any of your machines.

61
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:20,960
Both of these are good steps
in limiting the ability

62
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,810
of an attacker to be able
to gather information

63
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:24,473
about you and your network.
