1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,696
- File systems and hard drives.

2
00:00:02,696 --> 00:00:05,399
Another aspect of hardening
your operating system is

3
00:00:05,399 --> 00:00:08,633
determining exactly what file
system it should utilize.

4
00:00:08,633 --> 00:00:10,693
The level of security of your system

5
00:00:10,693 --> 00:00:12,710
is effected by its file system type.

6
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:14,673
There are many different file systems

7
00:00:14,673 --> 00:00:16,172
available to choose from.

8
00:00:16,172 --> 00:00:18,938
We have things like NTFS, FAT32,

9
00:00:18,938 --> 00:00:22,286
ext4, the Hierarchical File System Plus,

10
00:00:22,286 --> 00:00:24,308
and the Apple File System.

11
00:00:24,308 --> 00:00:26,497
Windows systems can utilize either

12
00:00:26,497 --> 00:00:28,747
NTFS or FAT32 file systems.

13
00:00:29,757 --> 00:00:31,122
It's highly recommended, though,

14
00:00:31,122 --> 00:00:33,614
that you use the NTFS file system.

15
00:00:33,614 --> 00:00:37,026
NTFS stands for the New
Technology File System,

16
00:00:37,026 --> 00:00:39,469
and it's the default
file system format for

17
00:00:39,469 --> 00:00:42,483
Windows because it's
more secure than FAT32.

18
00:00:42,483 --> 00:00:46,324
It supports, logging, encryption,
larger partition sizes,

19
00:00:46,324 --> 00:00:49,769
and larger file sizes than FAT32 does.

20
00:00:49,769 --> 00:00:52,006
If your Windows system is running FAT32,

21
00:00:52,006 --> 00:00:55,385
you can convert it to NTFS
without losing any data, though.

22
00:00:55,385 --> 00:00:58,350
The easiest method to do this
is to open a command prompt,

23
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:00,505
and type convert, the drive letter,

24
00:01:00,505 --> 00:01:04,506
and then /FS:NTFS and hit enter.

25
00:01:04,506 --> 00:01:06,942
This technique is
something you should have

26
00:01:06,942 --> 00:01:08,733
learned during your A+ studies.

27
00:01:08,733 --> 00:01:11,024
If you're using a Linux system, you should

28
00:01:11,024 --> 00:01:13,447
format the hard drive as ext4.

29
00:01:13,447 --> 00:01:15,739
If you're using a MacOSX
system, you should use

30
00:01:15,739 --> 00:01:17,996
Apple's File System, since it is the

31
00:01:17,996 --> 00:01:21,247
newest, and most secure
one supported by Apple.

32
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:23,064
In addition to choosing the right type of

33
00:01:23,064 --> 00:01:24,847
file system, as we just discussed,

34
00:01:24,847 --> 00:01:27,460
it's also important to
use whole disc encryption.

35
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:30,072
This will help increase the
security of your system.

36
00:01:30,072 --> 00:01:32,134
It's also important
for you to realize that

37
00:01:32,134 --> 00:01:34,357
hard drives will eventually fail.

38
00:01:34,357 --> 00:01:36,339
But there are five
things you can do to help

39
00:01:36,339 --> 00:01:39,283
postpone that failure, and
ease your recovery from it.

40
00:01:39,283 --> 00:01:41,701
First, you should remove
any temporary files

41
00:01:41,701 --> 00:01:45,363
from your system by using
a disc cleanup utility.

42
00:01:45,363 --> 00:01:48,690
Second, you should conduct
periodic file system checks.

43
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:50,484
If you're running Windows,
you can do this by

44
00:01:50,484 --> 00:01:53,271
running Check Disc, and
the System File Checker.

45
00:01:53,271 --> 00:01:55,865
If you're using Linux, you
should do a file system check

46
00:01:55,865 --> 00:01:58,448
by typing fsck in the terminal.

47
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:02,251
If you're using OSX, you
can run first aid from

48
00:02:02,251 --> 00:02:04,621
within the disc utility application.

49
00:02:04,621 --> 00:02:06,203
The third thing you should do is perform a

50
00:02:06,203 --> 00:02:08,855
disc drive defragmentation periodically.

51
00:02:08,855 --> 00:02:11,928
On a Windows system, you can
use the defrag command from the

52
00:02:11,928 --> 00:02:13,864
command line, or run the disc defragmenter

53
00:02:13,864 --> 00:02:16,602
from within the graphical user interface.

54
00:02:16,602 --> 00:02:18,185
The fourth thing you should do is ensure

55
00:02:18,185 --> 00:02:20,207
you have a good backup of you're data.

56
00:02:20,207 --> 00:02:23,019
After all, every hard
drive will fail one day,

57
00:02:23,019 --> 00:02:25,705
so it's important to
have a good backup copy.

58
00:02:25,705 --> 00:02:28,224
This can be performed using
different types of software or

59
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:31,118
cloud solutions, depending
on your business needs.

60
00:02:31,118 --> 00:02:33,587
The fifth and final thing you
should do is ensure that you

61
00:02:33,587 --> 00:02:35,529
understand how to use
different restoration

62
00:02:35,529 --> 00:02:38,067
techniques and actually practice them.

63
00:02:38,067 --> 00:02:40,358
This includes restoring
from a system restore point

64
00:02:40,358 --> 00:02:43,113
within Windows, restoring a
system from a tape backup, or

65
00:02:43,113 --> 00:02:45,175
backing up a hard drive, and even

66
00:02:45,175 --> 00:02:48,165
restoring an individual
file from your backups.

67
00:02:48,165 --> 00:02:50,581
After all, the only way
to truly verify that your

68
00:02:50,581 --> 00:02:54,177
backup copy is good, is to
attempt a restore from it.

69
00:02:54,177 --> 00:02:56,516
In one organization I consulted with,

70
00:02:56,516 --> 00:02:58,521
they had years worth of backup tapes.

71
00:02:58,521 --> 00:03:00,456
They spent countless hours and a lot of

72
00:03:00,456 --> 00:03:02,587
money on this take back of system.

73
00:03:02,587 --> 00:03:04,981
But, when they actually need
to restore from one of those

74
00:03:04,981 --> 00:03:07,279
tape back ups, they weren't able to do it,

75
00:03:07,279 --> 00:03:10,033
because the tape that
they needed was corrupted.

76
00:03:10,033 --> 00:03:12,931
If they had practiced restoring
that data to a test server,

77
00:03:12,931 --> 00:03:15,062
they would have known
earlier that that data wasn't

78
00:03:15,062 --> 00:03:18,598
really there, and they didn't
have a good backup copy.
