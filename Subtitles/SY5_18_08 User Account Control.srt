00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:03,170
- User Account Control.

2
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:05,330
I mentioned User Account
Control briefly before,

3
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:06,470
but we're going to cover
it a little bit more

4
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:07,900
in depth in this lesson.

5
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:09,560
First, let me ask you, how do you

6
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:11,060
log into your computer each day?

7
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:12,600
Are you logged in as an administrator,

8
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:14,690
or are you logged in as a normal user?

9
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:16,680
For me, I log in as a normal user,

10
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:18,500
and I only go to my administrator account

11
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:19,970
when I need to do something that an

12
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:21,080
administrator would have to do.

13
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:23,160
Like, install a program, remove a program,

14
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:24,890
or something else like that.

15
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:27,140
Now, user account control, or UAC,

16
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:29,460
is a security component inside of Windows,

17
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:31,900
that keeps every user
in standard user mode,

18
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:34,130
instead of acting like administrator user.

19
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:35,390
Now, the only exception to this,

20
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:37,640
is if you're logged in as
the administrator account.

21
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:40,350
That default administrator
that's created by Windows.

22
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:42,270
For that reason, I recommend disabling the

23
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:43,990
administrator account and logging in

24
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:46,120
as a standard user each time.

25
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,670
Now, there are two main benefits

26
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:50,410
to using UAC, or User Account Control.

27
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:52,640
The first one, is it
eliminates unnecessary

28
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,880
admin level requests
for Windows resources.

29
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,340
If you're browsing the internet,

30
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:58,450
you probably don't need
admin level rights to do it.

31
00:00:58,450 --> 00:01:00,920
And so, UAC keeps you as a user level,

32
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:04,120
until something that requires
admin level comes to play.

33
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:07,140
Number two, it's going to
reduce the risk of malware,

34
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:08,590
because it's going to
force you to be using

35
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:09,920
that user level credentials.

36
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,460
If you were browsing around
using admin level privileges,

37
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:14,730
this can cause system
issues, because the malware

38
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:16,370
will be running as an admin,

39
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:17,960
and you don't want that to happen.

40
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:19,550
So what does UAC look like?

41
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:20,890
Well, if you try to run a program,

42
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:23,260
or do something that requires
admin level permissions,

43
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:26,320
this box will show up, and
you simply have to click yes,

44
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,170
and it will let you go
and run that as an admin,

45
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:29,710
if you're an administrative user.

46
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:32,910
But normally, everything else
is going to be run as a user.

47
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:34,740
Now, some people don't like UAC,

48
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:36,010
and they want to turn it off.

49
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:36,960
Can you turn it off?

50
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:37,810
Well, yes.

51
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:41,110
You can turn off UAC by disabling
it from the control panel.

52
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:43,540
That said, I don't recommend doing that.

53
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:45,400
UAC is there for your benefit.

54
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,510
It's there to increase the
security of your system,

55
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:49,130
and it should be used to make sure

56
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:51,710
you're operating as a user, at all times,

57
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:53,910
except for when you
need to run as an admin.
