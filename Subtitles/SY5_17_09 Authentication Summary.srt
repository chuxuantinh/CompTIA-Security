1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:01,870
- Now, I know that we've covered

2
00:00:01,870 --> 00:00:03,330
a lot of different technologies

3
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:04,470
in this section of the course

4
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:06,190
as we discussed authentication.

5
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:09,140
So I wanted to do a quick
summarization for you.

6
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:11,020
This is a down and dirty summary

7
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:12,560
with only one to two sentences

8
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:14,640
per topic of the information we covered

9
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:16,620
and this is the stuff
that's most pertinent

10
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:19,200
and most likely to be seen on exam day.

11
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:23,070
First, 802.1x is an IEEE
standard that defines

12
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:26,295
Port-Based Network Access Control or PNAC.

13
00:00:26,295 --> 00:00:29,820
802.1x is a data link layer
authentication technology

14
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:33,110
that's used to connect devices
to a wired or wireless LAN.

15
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:36,400
Also, it defines the EAP protocol.

16
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:40,280
Second, LDAP is the light weight
directory access protocol.

17
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:42,800
It's an application layer
protocol for accessing

18
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,380
and modifying directory services data.

19
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:47,963
Microsoft's Active Directory uses LDAP.

20
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:51,640
Third, Kerberos is an
authentication protocol

21
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:53,830
that's used in Windows to identify clients

22
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:56,320
to a server using mutual authentication.

23
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,280
In Windows, this in implemented
through a series of tickets.

24
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:03,400
Fourth, Remote Access Services or RAS

25
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,080
is a service that enables dial-up

26
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:08,063
and VPN connections to
occur from remote clients.

27
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:12,350
Next, the Challenge
Handshake Protocol or CHAP

28
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:13,890
is an authentication scheme

29
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:16,670
that's used for standard
dial-up connections.

30
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:19,870
Next, RADIUS is a centralized
administration system

31
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:23,130
for dial-up, VPN and
wireless authentication.

32
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:25,047
It's going to use 1812 and 1813

33
00:01:25,995 --> 00:01:27,095
or ports 1645 and 1646

34
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:32,250
using UDP for it's transport mechanism.

35
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:35,623
RADIUS is used with 802.1x and EAP.

36
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:38,500
Finally, TACACS+.

37
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:42,330
TACACS+ is a Cisco proprietary
remote authentication system

38
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:44,010
that provides separate authentication

39
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:46,710
and authorization functions using port 49

40
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:48,586
over a TCP connection.

41
00:01:48,586 --> 00:01:50,530
TACACS+ is similar to RADIUS,

42
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:53,380
but it is not considered cross platform.

43
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:55,800
Once again, this was a very short lesson.

44
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,270
I just wanted to cover the highlights

45
00:01:57,270 --> 00:01:59,046
from this entire section of the course

46
00:01:59,046 --> 00:02:01,580
to make sure that you didn't
miss any of the key points

47
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:03,833
and key takeaways that
you need for the exam.
