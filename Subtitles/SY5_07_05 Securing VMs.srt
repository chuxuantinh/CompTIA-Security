1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:03,320
- So, now that I scared
you with all of the threats

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:05,130
that exists against virtual machines

3
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:07,670
let's talk about how we
can best secure them.

4
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:09,240
Most of the things that we need to do

5
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:11,580
to secure a virtual
machine are very similar

6
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:13,850
to things we need to
do to secure a regular

7
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:15,510
physical server too.

8
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:17,830
This includes things like
updating your operating system

9
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:19,230
in your applications.

10
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:21,770
Also, you need to ensure
that each virtual machine

11
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:24,140
has a good anti-virus solution installed.

12
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:27,120
With its own software
firewall, good strong passwords

13
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:29,830
and good policies and all of
the other security features

14
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:32,810
that we're going to discuss
throughout this course.

15
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:35,240
For this lesson, let's focus specifically

16
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:37,770
on how to secure virtual machines though.

17
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:41,190
First, remember that the
hypervisor whether it's a type one,

18
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:44,500
type two or application
containerization based model,

19
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,330
needs to be updated and secured

20
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:49,880
whenever the manufacturer
releases a new security patch.

21
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:52,530
For example, if an export have
been discovered then you can

22
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:55,370
now conduct a VM escape against VM ware,

23
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:57,830
you can be certain that accompanying
like VM ware is going to

24
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:01,890
quickly release a patch to fix
this critical vulnerability.

25
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:04,640
Next you want to ensure that you
limit the type of connections

26
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,600
that is existing between
the virtual machine

27
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,380
and the physical machine.

28
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:11,060
This can be represented by
a virtualized network card,

29
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:12,600
or even as network shares.

30
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,240
As I'm going to demonstrate
in the next lesson.

31
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:18,310
Remember if a virtual machine
gets infected with malware

32
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:21,050
it should remain isolated from
all the other virtual machine

33
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:23,040
hosted by the same hypervisor.

34
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,130
But only if you implement
your configurations

35
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:26,920
for isolation correctly.

36
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,570
Just like a physical server
anytime there is a connection

37
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:32,020
between a virtual machine
and a shared resource,

38
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:33,970
something like a network file server.

39
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:36,550
This is an opportunity for
data to be passed between

40
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:37,820
the different virtual machines,

41
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:39,630
and this would break down the isolation

42
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:41,550
that you may be achieving.

43
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:43,620
Just like we discussed back
in handling our operating

44
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:46,790
systems we want to minimize
and remove any features that

45
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:49,260
are not needed to support our operations.

46
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:50,830
When dealing with the virtual machine,

47
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:53,810
remember that hardware is
emilated and it can be removed

48
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:57,040
just like a piece of softare
would be under normal machine.

49
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,134
If don't your virtual machine
to have an emilated flappy

50
00:01:59,134 --> 00:02:01,560
disk or CD drive for example,

51
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,810
you can simply remove those features.

52
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:06,350
This in turn will
minimize your text surface

53
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:09,060
and remove potential vulnerabilities.

54
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:11,560
All of your virtual machines
are hosted on physical

55
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,000
computers or servers.

56
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,110
And so if you had many
virtual machine residing

57
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:17,190
on a same physical server,

58
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:18,890
and an attack is able to compromise

59
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:20,600
one of those virtual machines,

60
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:23,170
they maybe able to force
it to use a large amount of

61
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:25,120
physical server resources.

62
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,230
If they do this can affect the
other virtual machines hosted

63
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:29,720
on that same server.

64
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:33,510
In fact this could result and
denial servers for one or more

65
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:35,910
of the virtual machines being hosted.

66
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:38,470
To minimize this threat you
should consider spreading out

67
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:41,330
your virtual machines among
several physical servers.

68
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:44,320
In steady of relying on one
single physical server to host

69
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,480
every single virtual machine.

70
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,860
As assessment administrator,

71
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:50,100
its also important to keep
tracking your virtual machines

72
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:52,050
and where they are being deployed.

73
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:55,150
Each virtual machine represents
a fully operating system

74
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:57,510
and therefore you have to
ensure you're doing proper

75
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:58,510
patch management,

76
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:01,760
to make sure all of these
virtual machines stay up to date.

77
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,790
Additionally it becomes common
for Virtualization Sprawl

78
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:07,090
to occur within an organization.

79
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:09,820
Virtualization Sprawl refers
to when virtual machines are

80
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:13,690
created, used and deployed
without proper oversight

81
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:16,860
governance or management by
the system administrators.

82
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:18,500
Because virtual machines only exists

83
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,090
as a file on some server,

84
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:22,080
it's really easy to loose track of them.

85
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,890
And you'll not remember
where you've actually

86
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:24,840
deployed them all.

87
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:25,695
And when it comes time to
update them or retire them

88
00:03:25,695 --> 00:03:29,660
you sometimes just lose track.

89
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:32,730
Finally it's important to enable
encryption of the file that

90
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:34,590
host the virtual machines as well.

91
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:37,370
In the next lesson I'm going
to demonstrate how easy it is

92
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:40,170
to encrypt your virtual
machine files to keep them safe

93
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:42,160
from prying eyes on the server.

94
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,720
This will make sure that
when you're deploying them

95
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,130
and using them in your network,

96
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:47,383
everything remain safe and confidential.
