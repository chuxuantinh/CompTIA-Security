00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:03,430
- As promised, here are my
top five tips for increasing

2
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:06,860
your score on the CompTIA
security plus exam and really any

3
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:08,990
CompTIA exam you take in the future.

4
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:11,430
Number one; use a cheat sheet.

5
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:13,590
Now I'm not talking about
writing it down on a piece

6
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:15,270
of paper and carrying
it into the test center

7
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:17,480
because you're not allowed
to carry anything into the

8
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:18,620
test center with you.

9
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:21,550
But they are going to give you
a a white board or dry erase

10
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:23,630
sheet that's the size
of about a normal piece

11
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:24,780
of printer paper.

12
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:27,600
Once the clock starts you're
allowed to brain dump stuff

13
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:30,580
onto that paper, things
like ports and terms and

14
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:32,810
anything else you might
forget by the time you get to

15
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:34,530
question 66 and beyond.

16
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:37,770
So while you know that
port 80 is http right now,

17
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:40,040
you might forget it somewhere
towards the end of the exam

18
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,590
when it's been about an hour, right.

19
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:43,560
You get fatigued and you
start forgetting things.

20
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:46,520
So I do recommend writing
things down like ports,

21
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,970
protocols, anything that you
might think you're going to

22
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:51,190
forget by the second half of the exam.

23
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:54,300
Using that cheat sheet is going
to be really helpful for you.

24
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:56,750
Second, skip the simulations.

25
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:59,700
Yes the simulations, or
performance based questions

26
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:02,440
as CompTIA calls it, are
usually the first three to five

27
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:04,080
questions on the exam.

28
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,740
Now these simulations actually
account for more points than

29
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:09,940
multiple choice so why am I
telling you to skip them first?

30
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:12,260
Well it's because most
students find these to be the

31
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:15,550
hardest questions on the
exam, so my recommendation is

32
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:18,400
when the exam starts simply
mark them for review,

33
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,560
skip them and do all of your
multiple choice items first.

34
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:24,000
I've seen students who will
spend an hour on those first

35
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,200
five simulations and then
run out of time for the

36
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,210
multiple choice and they fail the exam.

37
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:30,450
Instead I want you to go
through all the multiple choice

38
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:33,340
first and you'll still
probably have about 45 minutes

39
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:35,520
or 30 minutes left to do the simulations.

40
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,670
They don't take that long
but they are more difficult

41
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:41,080
and so by skipping them
you're going to gain a lot of

42
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:43,170
confidence going through those
multiple choice questions

43
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:45,530
first, and then when you get
to the simulations you're

44
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:47,350
actually going to remember
things from the multiple choice

45
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:49,690
that'll help you answer
some of those questions.

46
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:51,500
Third, take a guess.

47
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,430
When in doubt take a guess.

48
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:56,510
On the CompTIA security plus
and all of the CompTIA exams

49
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:59,870
there is no penalty for wrong
answers so when in doubt

50
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:02,640
try to eliminate as many
choices as possible and guess

51
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,450
between those remaining choices.

52
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:07,320
The multiple choice questions
only have four options

53
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,440
so you know that if you find
one or two of those that

54
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,890
aren't right, you're already
exponentially increasing

55
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:14,310
your chances of guessing the
correct answer out of the

56
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:17,220
remaining three or two
options that are left.

57
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,990
Now fourth, I want you to pick
the best time for the exam.

58
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:21,300
This is really important.

59
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,400
Are you a morning person
or a night person?

60
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,450
Pick the time of day
that works best for you.

61
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:27,660
You want to be awake, you want
to be alert and you want to

62
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:28,880
be well rested.

63
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:31,240
Don't try to squeeze the
exam in after working a long

64
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,310
day at the office.

65
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:35,490
Personally I like to schedule
my exams around 10am.

66
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:37,590
That way I don't have
to wake up super early,

67
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:40,180
I can avoid rush hour traffic
going to the testing center

68
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:42,387
and I can get there and just
kind of relax before I go

69
00:02:42,387 --> 00:02:43,920
and take the exam.

70
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,330
Now when you schedule your
exam also make sure you allow

71
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:48,660
enough time to relax before the exam.

72
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:51,540
One of the things I do is I
show up about 30 minutes early.

73
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:53,860
There's nothing worse than
showing up at a testing center

74
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:57,320
at nine 59 when your exam
is scheduled to start at 10.

75
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:00,040
Instead show up 20 to 30 minutes earlier,

76
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:02,220
you can sit in your car for
a little bit and calm down.

77
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:03,860
You can go upstairs and use the restroom,

78
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:05,630
and then go check in for the exam.

79
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:08,650
This will help increase
your score, I promise you.

80
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:11,860
Now my final and fifth
tip is be confident.

81
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:13,140
You have got this.

82
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:14,180
You can do this.

83
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:16,150
When you walk into the
testing center, you shouldn't

84
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:18,710
be wondering if you're going
to pass, instead you should

85
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:20,830
already have studied all the
information in this course.

86
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:23,380
You've watched all the videos,
you've taken all the quizzes,

87
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:25,820
you've downloaded the study
guide, you've gone through it

88
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:28,000
and now you're going to go
take my practice exam right

89
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,070
after this video.

90
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:31,500
If you aren't confident right
now then you need to wait

91
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,470
to schedule your exam
until you've taken a bunch

92
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:34,740
of practice exams.

93
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:37,060
In this course I have a
full length practice exam

94
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:38,910
that's going to help you
determine if you're ready

95
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:39,990
for the exam.

96
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:42,100
Take that practice exam
and if you aren't scoring

97
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:44,780
high enough, restudy the
areas you missed and then take

98
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:45,613
it again.

99
00:03:45,613 --> 00:03:46,930
Still not confident?

100
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:49,420
Go and find more practice
exams to take, either on this

101
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:51,970
site or from a text book or other sites.

102
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:54,560
Keep practicing these exams
until you feel confident

103
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,550
and ready to go and
then schedule the exam,

104
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:59,530
walk in there knowing
you're going to pass,

105
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:02,440
just like he did, and if
you follow my five tips

106
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,620
you're going to be ready to
take the security plus exam

107
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:06,730
and pass it on your first attempt.

108
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:09,433
Now, let's go ahead and get you certified.
