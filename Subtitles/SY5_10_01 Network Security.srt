00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:02,480
- In this section, we're
going to talk about

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:04,750
some of the different devices
that make up our networks

3
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:06,020
and some of the different attacks

4
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:07,320
that are used against them.

5
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:09,651
But before we do that,
we're going to cover quickly

6
00:00:09,651 --> 00:00:13,350
the basics of the networks by
going through the OSI model.

7
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:15,120
Now in this section of the course,

8
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,040
we're going to do this as a quick review

9
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:18,210
because you should have already learned

10
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:20,221
the OSI model and the basics of networking

11
00:00:20,221 --> 00:00:23,750
back when you studied Network
Plus, which is recommended

12
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:25,820
before you take the Security Plus exam.

13
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:26,840
Now if you haven't gone through

14
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:28,220
the Network Plus course already,

15
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:31,610
I highly recommend you go
back and review that content

16
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:33,460
before taking the Security Plus.

17
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:35,320
Whether you take the Network
Plus certification exam

18
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:38,690
or not, the information
contained in that curriculum

19
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:40,510
is really important to understand

20
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:42,250
so you can better understand the security

21
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:45,086
that we're talking about
throughout this course.

22
00:00:45,086 --> 00:00:47,381
