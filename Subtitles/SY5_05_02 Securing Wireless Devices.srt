00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:03,250
- We all use wireless devices these days.

2
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:06,640
Whether it's your laptop, your
tablet, or your smartphone,

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:09,980
all of these have the ability
to communicate wirelessly.

4
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:12,370
How can we best secure these devices?

5
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:14,660
Well, there's two main things
we have to think about when

6
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:17,010
we talk about wireless with these devices:

7
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:19,340
wifi and Bluetooth.

8
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:22,260
First, wifi, is there
internet connectivity?

9
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:25,760
If we're using wifi, we want
to make sure the wifi is set

10
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,090
to be protected at the highest levels.

11
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:31,350
Currently, that's WPA2, or Wifi Protected

12
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:33,070
Access Version Two.

13
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:35,420
This relies on the advanced
encryption standard

14
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:38,173
for its encryption
algorithm, also known as AES.

15
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:42,320
In addition to securing our
wifi, we also have to consider

16
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,020
the peripherals that
connect to these devices.

17
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:47,420
For example, if you have a
smartphone and it connects

18
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:51,210
to a Bluetooth to your car,
how is that link being secured?

19
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:54,830
Well, by default, Bluetooth
requires you to pair the device

20
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:57,160
and when you pair the
device, the two devices will

21
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:00,180
communicate via that shared
link in giving each other

22
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:01,630
a shared link key.

23
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:04,300
They use that key to encrypt their data.

24
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:07,470
Unfortunately, some of these
devices use weaker encryption

25
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:09,670
than others, so if you're
really worried about

26
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:12,490
your confidentiality, you
should always try to avoid

27
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:14,470
wireless devices when possible.

28
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:17,280
If you have to use a wireless
device like headphones

29
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,650
or connecting to your car, you should look

30
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:22,830
at the manufacturer specifications
to determine what type

31
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:26,110
of encryption is being used
and if they're not using AES

32
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:28,900
with a strong key, you might
want to pass on using that

33
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:31,170
device and buy a replacement.

34
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:33,260
