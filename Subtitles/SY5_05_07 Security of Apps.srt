1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:01,980
- Security of Apps.

2
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:04,740
How do you know the app you
want to install is secure?

3
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:07,020
How do you know it's not
going to be spying on you?

4
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:09,490
How do you know there's
no malware embedded in it?

5
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:10,770
Well, you don't.

6
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:12,510
But the best way to ensure that you don't

7
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:15,106
get those type of things is
by installing applications

8
00:00:15,106 --> 00:00:17,810
from the official mobile stores only.

9
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:19,037
If you're using an Android device,

10
00:00:19,037 --> 00:00:20,737
that's the Google Play store.

11
00:00:20,737 --> 00:00:21,997
If you're using an Iphone,

12
00:00:21,997 --> 00:00:24,360
that's going to be the App Store.

13
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:26,398
Now, some people have taken their phones

14
00:00:26,398 --> 00:00:29,632
and done what's called jail
breaking it or rooting it.

15
00:00:29,632 --> 00:00:31,300
On an Apple device,

16
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:33,320
jail breaking it means
you're going to remove

17
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:35,478
the security protections
that Apple has put in place

18
00:00:35,478 --> 00:00:38,010
so that you can take it
from your wireless carrier

19
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:39,017
to a different wireless carrier

20
00:00:39,017 --> 00:00:42,548
or install third party apps
outside of the App Store.

21
00:00:42,548 --> 00:00:43,776
As you can probably guess,

22
00:00:43,776 --> 00:00:46,550
these are both bad security practices

23
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:48,009
and should not be done.

24
00:00:48,009 --> 00:00:50,080
Now, we you have an Android device

25
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,400
we don't call jail breaking it,

26
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,575
we call it rooting it.

27
00:00:52,575 --> 00:00:54,860
The reason is because Android is at heart

28
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:56,450
a Linux operating system.

29
00:00:56,450 --> 00:00:57,566
So if you root the device,

30
00:00:57,566 --> 00:01:00,240
you now have administrative
permissions over it.

31
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,500
And you can install whatever
applications you want

32
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:03,820
and make the phone do things

33
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:06,290
that it wasn't necessarily designed to do.

34
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:08,770
Again, making sure that
you don't jail break

35
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:11,050
or root your device is a good first step

36
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:13,057
to ensuring you have a secure device.

37
00:01:13,057 --> 00:01:15,817
Next, you want to think about what browser

38
00:01:15,817 --> 00:01:18,246
and what applications
you're actually running.

39
00:01:18,246 --> 00:01:21,350
For example, if you're
using the Chrome browser,

40
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:23,086
that's a fairly secure web browser.

41
00:01:23,086 --> 00:01:25,897
But if you decide to get
a third party web browser,

42
00:01:25,897 --> 00:01:28,480
you don't know who it is
that put that out there

43
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:30,030
and if you can trust them.

44
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:31,700
Maybe they're giving you this web browser

45
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:32,980
but they're also taking a copy

46
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:34,366
of all your data going through it.

47
00:01:34,366 --> 00:01:35,836
To avoid those type of issues,

48
00:01:35,836 --> 00:01:39,276
always get official
applications when possible.

49
00:01:39,276 --> 00:01:41,806
And speaking of web browsers,

50
00:01:41,806 --> 00:01:43,580
one of the things you want to ensure

51
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:45,935
is whenever browsing the
web on your mobile device,

52
00:01:45,935 --> 00:01:48,897
you're always going to the
secure version of a website.

53
00:01:48,897 --> 00:01:53,406
That's denoted by the https at
the front of the web address.

54
00:01:53,406 --> 00:01:56,236
This ensures that you
have a TLS tunnel created

55
00:01:56,236 --> 00:01:58,665
between your phone and the server.

56
00:01:58,665 --> 00:02:00,057
What's TLS?

57
00:02:00,057 --> 00:02:02,494
Well, it's Transport Layer Security.

58
00:02:02,494 --> 00:02:05,600
It's going to put a
encryption layer and a tunnel

59
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,500
between your device and the server

60
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,160
to ensure you have
confidentiality and nobody

61
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,513
is conducting a man in the
middle attack from you.

62
00:02:12,513 --> 00:02:16,090
Now as businesses, we are
increasingly going mobile

63
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:17,210
all of the time.

64
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:19,650
An Enterprise Mobility
has a couple of things

65
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:20,770
that we need to think about

66
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:23,470
when we talk about
securing our apps as well.

67
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:25,499
One of those, is making
sure we have control

68
00:02:25,499 --> 00:02:28,658
over those devices and
what apps are installed.

69
00:02:28,658 --> 00:02:30,280
If your organization is going to be

70
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,510
providing the cellphone to its employees,

71
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:34,170
you have the right to install

72
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:35,930
mobile device management software.

73
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:38,500
MDM or Mobile Device Management

74
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,050
is a centralized software solution

75
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:42,970
that allows your system
administrators to create

76
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:45,960
and enforce policies across
all of the mobile devices.

77
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:48,260
This can ensure that
people don't install games

78
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:51,131
like Angry Birds or they
don't put a third party apps

79
00:02:51,131 --> 00:02:54,550
or that they could only
go to certain websites.

80
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:56,500
Whatever precautions you want to enable

81
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,210
and whatever policies you want to enforce

82
00:02:58,210 --> 00:02:59,519
is really up to your organization.

83
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:02,159
But in the end, it's the
thing that lets you do that.

84
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:04,510
Now, one of the things
that you want to consider

85
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:07,948
with your phones is they have
location access based on GPS.

86
00:03:07,948 --> 00:03:11,439
Should you allow location
access to an application?

87
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:14,220
For example if you trying
to get use the Yelp app,

88
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:16,210
it needs to know your location

89
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:17,500
so it can make recommendations

90
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,270
of the restaurants around you.

91
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:21,370
Well, if you enable
location access to apps

92
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:23,170
and you're not sure who that app is,

93
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:26,620
that app can now track your
location and where you're going.

94
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:28,150
This is a privacy concern

95
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:30,040
and something you need to think about.

96
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:32,690
It's highly recommended that
you turn location services off

97
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:35,231
for any apps that you don't need it for.

98
00:03:35,231 --> 00:03:37,601
Obviously, you're going to
need it for your GPS app

99
00:03:37,601 --> 00:03:41,290
but for most other apps
you don't need GPS enabled.

100
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:43,540
So you can turn it off
for those particular apps

101
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:45,350
in your settings.

102
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:48,540
Another privacy concern
is the use of Geo tags.

103
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:49,982
What exactly is Geotagging?

104
00:03:49,982 --> 00:03:53,480
Well, Geotagging is embedding
the geolocation coordinates

105
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:56,460
or GPS coordinates into a piece of data.

106
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:59,484
Most commonly, this is done
with a photo or a video.

107
00:03:59,484 --> 00:04:02,484
By default on your Iphone
when you take a picture,

108
00:04:02,484 --> 00:04:05,180
your GPS coordinates are embedded

109
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:07,774
into that photo as metadata.

110
00:04:07,774 --> 00:04:09,894
That means wherever you post that photo

111
00:04:09,894 --> 00:04:12,910
like on Facebook or Twitter or Flicker,

112
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:15,680
you could take that photo
and read those coordinates

113
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,280
and figure out where all
those photos were taken.

114
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:20,030
Now this is really handy if you went

115
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:21,350
and took a trip around the world

116
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:22,183
and want to figure out

117
00:04:22,183 --> 00:04:24,120
which picture went with which location.

118
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,763
But, it does bring some
dangers to your organization.

119
00:04:26,763 --> 00:04:30,123
For example, what if
every morning your manager

120
00:04:30,123 --> 00:04:32,023
went to a local coffee shop

121
00:04:32,023 --> 00:04:33,710
and they decide to take a picture

122
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:37,141
and post it on Facebook
everyday around 8am.

123
00:04:37,141 --> 00:04:39,730
This would tell an
attacker that that manager

124
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:42,040
is not in the office everyday at 8am

125
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,754
instead they are at the coffee shop.

126
00:04:43,754 --> 00:04:46,527
They can now target that manager
either at the coffee shop

127
00:04:46,527 --> 00:04:48,447
or target that manager's office

128
00:04:48,447 --> 00:04:50,670
because they know the
location of the manager

129
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:53,260
and where they won't be, in the office.

130
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:55,439
So, geotagging is something
that needs to be considered

131
00:04:55,439 --> 00:04:58,239
when developing your
organization security policies.

132
00:04:58,239 --> 00:04:59,837
It's up to your organization to decide

133
00:04:59,837 --> 00:05:02,470
whether or not you want
to allow geotagging

134
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:03,929
but I highly recommend turning it off

135
00:05:03,929 --> 00:05:06,659
for privacy and security concerns.
